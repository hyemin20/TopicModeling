The inhibitory impact of collaboration on the continued influence effect of misinformation,25 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1487146/full,"Gongxiang Chen, Yuxuan Zhong, Sujie Li","The continued influence effect (CIE) of misinformation refers to the persistence of misinformation’s impact on memory and inference even when individuals are aware of a retraction. This study examined whether collaborative processes affect the CIE and investigated the underlying mechanisms through three experiments. Experiment 1 explored the general impact of collaboration on the CIE. Experiment 2 further dissected collaboration into turn-taking and free collaboration conditions, assessing their effects on the CIE at various recall intervals. Building on these findings, Experiment 3 delved into the mechanisms driving the differential effects of turn-taking and free collaboration on misinformation correction. Results revealed that turn-taking collaboration consistently mitigates the CIE, while the effect of free collaboration on misinformation correction is moderated by recall time. This variation is attributed to differences in re-exposure, cross-cuing, and forgetting across collaboration types. The present study contributes empirical support to the Knowledge Revision Theory of the CIE."
RECALL prompting hierarchy improves responsiveness for autistic children and children with language delay: a single-case design study,25 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1435688/full,"Rebekah Bosley, Susan J. Loveall, Karen Kate Kellum, Kara Hawthorne,","The purpose of the current study was to expand upon previous research on RECALL, a dialogic reading intervention modified for autistic children aimed at increasing engagement. Children ages 3–6 years (n= 6) with language delays with or without co-occurring autism were tested using a multiple baseline across participants design. During baseline, the interventionist used dialogic reading and asked questions after every page. During intervention, the interventionist used RECALL, including a least to most prompting hierarchy with visual prompt cards. Children were more responsive and produced more meaningful correct responses during the intervention. Response type (linguistic vs. non-linguistic) also changed from baseline to intervention, though the pattern varied across participants. Intervention was not associated with increased responsiveness to adult bids for attention or pauses designed to encourage the child to initiate an interaction, though a few children showed changes in these responses over time."
Assessing key soft skills in organizational contexts: development and validation of the multiple soft skills assessment tool,25 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1405822/full,"Daiana Colledani, Egidio Robusto, Pasquale Anselmi","Introduction:Soft skills, also known as transversal skills, have gained significant attention in the organizational context due to their positive impact on various work-related outcomes.

The impact of job stress on job satisfaction and turnover intentions among bank employees during the COVID-19 pandemic,25 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1482968/full,"Mei-Hui Lin, Ya-Hui Yen, Tsai-Fu Chuang, Ping-Sen Yang, Ming-Da Chuang","Objective:The main objective of this study is to explore the relationships among job stress, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions among bank employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on variations across different demographic characteristics."
Mapping perceived sentiments in university campuses with varied landscape metrics and climatic conditions,25 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1467966/full,"Qiyuan Yan, Yuxiang Sun","A sustainable university campus should accommodate students to experience positive emotions, which can be evoked by sustainable landscape with green and blue spaces (GBS). This effect is location-dependent because local vegetative type is climate-determinative, but evidence is not sufficient for sentiments of people experiencing campus landscapes. Forty-seven university campuses were selected along a latitudinal gradient in mainland China, and 100 subjects were chosen per campus (50 indoor and 50 outdoor). Photos of the subjects’ faces on Sina Weibo were collected. Facial expressions were assigned happy, sad, and neutral scores (n= 4,334). The average temperature (AveT) and blue space area (BlueA) showed negative relationships with latitude, thereby generating neutral emotion scores for subjects at indoor and outdoor locations. The ratio of green space area to host campus was the only landscape metric that depressed the presentation of happiness and enhanced sadness levels. Large water bodies should be built on campuses to induce calmness, and a high ratio of green spaces should be avoided. Mapping results show that campuses in eastern regions (Beijing and Liaoning) tend to elicit positive sentiments more frequently."

Confirmatory validation of a brief patient-reported outcome measure assessing psychological distress in caregivers of malignant mesothelioma patients: the Mesothelioma Psychological Distress Tool–Caregivers,23 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1444960/full,"Antonella Granieri, Isabella Giulia Franzoi, Maria Domenica Sauta, Alessandro Marinaccio, Carolina Mensi, Sabrina Rugarli, Enrica Migliore, Ilaria Cozzi, Domenica Cavone, Luigi Vimercati, Federica Grosso, Marinella Bertolotti, Giulia Raimondi, Marco Innamorati, Michela Bonafede","Objective:The diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma (MM) can be devastating for both patients and caregivers, who may experience intense suffering from a physical, psychological, and interpersonal perspective. Despite the extensive literature on caregiver distress, there is a lack of validated measures to provide evidence of psychological distress of caregivers of MM patients. Therefore, in a previous study we developed the Mesothelioma Psychological Distress Tool–Caregivers (MPDT-C) to evaluate the specific profile of psychological distress in this population. This paper describes the item selection, factor analysis, and psychometric evaluation of the revised MPDT-C."

Alignment of color discrimination in humans and image segmentation networks,23 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1415958/full,"Pablo Hernández-Cámara, Paula Daudén-Oliver, Valero Laparra, Jesús Malo","The experiments allowed by current machine learning models imply a revival of the debate on the causes of specific trends of human visual psychophysics. Machine learning facilitates the exploration of the effect of specific visual goals (such as image segmentation) by different neural architectures in different statistical environments in an unprecedented manner. In this way, (1) the principles behind psychophysical facts such as the non-Euclidean nature of human color discrimination and (2) the emergence of human-like behaviour in artificial systems can be explored under a new light. In this work, we show for the first time that thetoleranceorinvarianceof image segmentation networks for natural images under changes of illuminant in the color space (a sort of insensitivity region around thewhite) is anellipsoidoriented similarly to a (human) MacAdam ellipse. This striking similarity between an artificial system and human vision motivates a set of experiments checking the relevance of the statistical environment on the emergence of such insensitivity regions. Results suggest, that in this case, the statistics of the environment may be more relevant than the architecture selected to perform the image segmentation."

Behavioral trace data in an online learning environment as indicators of learning engagement in university students,23 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1396881/full,"Marc Winter, Julia Mordel, Julia Mendzheritskaya, Daniel Biedermann, George-Petru Ciordas-Hertel, Carolin Hahnel, Daniel Bengs, Ilka Wolter, Frank Goldhammer, Hendrik Drachsler, Cordula Artelt, Holger Horz","Learning in asynchronous online settings (AOSs) is challenging for university students. However, the construct of learning engagement (LE) represents a possible lever to identify and reduce challenges while learning online, especially, in AOSs. Learning analytics provides a fruitful framework to analyze students' learning processes and LE via trace data. The study, therefore, addresses the questions of whether LE can be modeled with the sub-dimensions of effort, attention, and content interest and by which trace data, derived from behavior within an AOS, these facets of LE are represented in self-reports. Participants were 764 university students attending an AOS. The results of best-subset regression analysis show that a model combining multiple indicators can account for a proportion of the variance in students' LE (highly significantR2between 0.04 and 0.13). The identified set of indicators is stable over time supporting the transferability to similar learning contexts. The results of this study can contribute to both research on learning processes in AOSs in higher education and the application of learning analytics in university teaching (e.g., modeling automated feedback)."

Ethnic origin of Israeli Jews and psychological responses to the extreme stress of the ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza,23 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1403132/full,"Yohanan Eshel, Shaul Kimhi, Hadas Marciano, Bruria Adini","Introduction:Discrimination constitutes a source of stress for minority groups, leading to heightened levels of depression. Discrimination can also elicit positive responses aimed at reducing detrimental impacts. The stress experienced by minority groups may impact their mindset and influence their negative emotional responses. Israeli Jewish society comprised for many years two large communities: the dominant Ashkenazi people, who emigrated from East Europe, and the Mizrahi discriminated minority whose members came from Muslim countries. The Mizrahi minority has become a mainstream community over time, and its size equals the Ashkenazi group. This change raises an interesting issue that has not been investigated empirically: What characterizes the psychological responses to the stress of a formerly discriminated minority?"

Self-regulatory and metacognitive instruction regarding student conceptions: influence on students’ self-efficacy and cognitive load,22 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1450947/full,"Tim Hartelt, Helge Martens","Self-regulatory and metacognitive instruction regarding student conceptions can help students become metacognitively (or more specifically, metaconceptually) aware of their conceptions and self-regulate their intuitive conceptions in scientific contexts when they are not appropriate. Two approaches have been found effective in enhancing conceptual knowledge: (a) self-assessing one’s conceptions and (b) acquiring conditional metaconceptual knowledge about why and in which contexts specific conceptions are appropriate or not. However, it is unclear how these approaches influence other cognitive and affective variables, such as self-efficacy and cognitive load. Nevertheless, it is essential to investigate whether making students aware of their intuitive conceptions affects their self-efficacy and to what extent reflecting on one’s conceptions requires additional (meta-)cognitive resources. Thus, we conducted an experimental intervention study using a 2×2 factorial design withN= 602 upper secondary biology students. Becoming metaconceptually aware of one’s (intuitive) conceptions did not lower students’ self-efficacy but enabled more accurate beliefs about their abilities. However, the self-assessment increased mental load, which partly suppressed the beneficial effect of the self-assessment on conceptual knowledge. In contrast, the instruction on conditional metaconceptual knowledge did not result in higher mental load and, thus, aligned more with students’ cognitive capacities. Furthermore, students with more pronounced general metaconceptual thinking reported lower mental load, implying that regular instruction focusing on metaconceptual thinking may reduce load. Thus, it is suggested to continuously promote students’ metaconceptual thinking and to embed metaconceptual activities (e.g., self-assessments) repeatedly across longer instructional units."
The psychological mechanisms of the better-than-average effect in the moral and competence domains under self-enhancement and self-protection motives among young Japanese adults,22 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1367568/full,"Yi Ding, Motoaki Sugiura,","The better-than-average effect (BTAE) refers to the phenomenon where individuals perceive themselves as better than the average person. This effect has been independently examined in terms of social perception dimension and motivation. Additionally, no psychobehavioral traits have been found to be associated with the BTAE in the moral domain. However, the interactive effects of social perception dimension and motivation on the BTAE remain unclear, and its association with a broad range of psychobehavioral traits has not been extensively validated. In this study, we assess self-and average other-evaluations across four domains, based on two social perception dimensions and two motivations, to investigate their interactive effects on the BTAE (n= 678). We measured seven sets of psychobehavioral characteristics to examine their association with the BTAE, as well as self-and other-evaluations. Results indicated that the BTAE occurred only under negative moral conditions, while the worse-than-others effect was observed under two competence conditions. Furthermore, the BTAE was associated with only a few psychobehavioral characteristics in the moral domains, compared to many in the competence domains. Notably, both self-and other-evaluations were correlated with many trust-relevant characteristics in the moral domains. These findings suggest that sociocultural dynamics may influence the BTAE differently across various domains."

Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through interviews and various scales, employing a mixed-method design. The results indicated that students had positive feelings about P4C, including appreciation, curiosity, surprise, excitement, self-confidence, and empathy. They believed that P4C enhanced their problem-solving, creativity, questioning, effective speaking, and collaboration skills. However, some students also expressed negative views, tough less frequently, citing issues such as nonsense, limited time, the necessity of prior knowledge, and lack of idea diversification. Quantitative data revealed that P4C activities significantly improved the speaking skills of gifted students and notably reduced their speaking anxiety. Additionally, sex and program variables showed no significant effect on speaking skills and speaking anxiety."
Relations of coping strategies and cognitive emotion regulation to Chinese children’s academic achievement goals and academic performance,22 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1454886/full,"Li Chen-Bouck, Meagan M. Patterson, Anqi Peng","Social–emotional skills (e.g., emotion regulation) influence a variety of academic outcomes among children. This study examined the relations of coping strategies and cognitive emotion regulation (CER) to academic achievement goals and academic performance among Chinese children (N= 401, ageM= 10.52 years). Full Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis showed that children’s use of active coping strategies was positively associated with their endorsement of performance approach and mastery avoidance goals. Avoidant and support-seeking coping strategies were not associated with any outcome variables. Maladaptive CER was positively associated with performance approach, performance avoidance, and mastery avoidance goals and negatively associated with academic performance; adaptive CER was positively associated with mastery approach goals but not associated with other outcome variables. The current study provided some preliminary evidence to indicate that active coping strategies, maladaptive CER, and adaptive CER were associated with academic achievement goals and academic performance among Chinese children. Although maladaptive CER was not used as often as adaptive CER by Chinese children, the more they used maladaptive CER, the more likely they were to have academic achievement goals that focused on things other than learning itself, whereas the more Chinese children used adaptive CER, the more likely they were to set an achievement goal to master the knowledge. Therefore, in teaching practices or intervention planning, decreasing maladaptive CER strategies may be as important as cultivating adaptive CER strategies to facilitate academic success among Chinese children."
Listening comprehension in a home language: a case of Russian in Germany,22 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1426831/full,"Luca Gacs, Anna Ritter, Evghenia Goltsev","Listening comprehension is central to language learning, yet it remains the least understood and least researched skill. This statement is still relevant today, as there is insufficient research to explore listening comprehension from the perspective of family-related multilingualism and to consider the complete linguistic repertoire of multilingual speakers. Moreover, with regard to home language, listening comprehension is assumed to be a more developed language competence than reading or writing. Based on the mentioned research, the aim of the present study is to investigate listening comprehension and its influencing factors specifically in German-Russian simultaneous bilinguals aged 13–19 (n= 99) by considering the home- and majority language. The study uses quantitative data collection methods such as linguistic tests in Russian and German for the elicitation in different levels of listening and questionnaires for strategy use and background. The research questions are as follows: What does the language proficiency and input in Russian look like? (1) Regarding listening comprehension in Russian as a home language, are there differences between the speakers within comprehension on different levels, e.g., is sound decoding easier than sentence parsing? (2) If there are differences in Russian as a home language, which linguistic and background variables can correlate with the performance of listening comprehension on its different levels? Concerning the first research question, the results show relevant differences between four different levels of listening comprehension (phoneme, word, sentence, and text level), which strengthened the assumed complexity of listening comprehension in the home language. In addition, the results show different connections between the listening comprehension competence and the input from different family members, as well as exposure to film and television in the home and majority language."

Child-friendly family reduces parenting stress in Chinese families: the mediating role of family resilience,21 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1430005/full,"Amanda Man Ying Chu, Jenny Tsun Yee Tsang, Agnes Tiwari, Helina Yuk, Mike Ka Pui So","The increasing prevalence of parenting stress has significant implications for the psychological well-being of both parents and children. In view of this, our study sought to examine the mediating and moderating role of family resilience in the association between child-friendly family and parenting stress. Our analysis involved a sample of 316 parents who dedicated a minimum of 14 h per week to caring for their children. The parents were invited to complete three validated instruments—the parenting stress index short form (PSI), the family resilience assessment scale (FRAS), and inventory of the child-friendly family (ICF)—to evaluate their level of parenting stress, family resilience, and child-friendly family, respectively. We tested the mediation model by applying structural equation model analysis. It was found that child-friendly family negatively correlated with parenting stress (path coefficient = −0.56,p< 0.001). This relationship is mediated by family resilience. That is “child-friendly family” leads to increased “family resilience” (path coefficient = 0.68,p< 0.01), which in turn leads to lower “parenting stress” (path coefficient = −0.30,p< 0.05). The mediation effect ratio was 26.70%. We used multiple regression analysis to test the moderation model and found that family resilience did not play a moderating role between child-friendly family and parenting stress. This study holds particular significance for two key reasons: Firstly, it elucidates the relationship between child-friendly family, family resilience, and parenting stress, highlighting the potential of creating a child-friendly family to reduce parenting stress through the enhancement of family resilience. Secondly, our findings provide valuable evidence for the development of innovative approaches that effectively and sustainably alleviate parenting stress."

Participants were 203 school children, 96 boys (47.3%) and 107 girls (52.7%), aged 7–8 years (M = 92.42 months, SD = 3.52). Fathers reported their educational level, age and employment status and their children’s gender and number of siblings, as well as their overparenting behaviors by Anticipatory Problem Solving (APS) scale. Teachers informed children’s school problems by the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC T-2). Parents together informed their children’s surgency levels by a subscale of Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). Results showed that, in girls, the father’s educational level was negatively related to the child’s school problems via overparenting behaviors, controlling the number of siblings and father’s age and employment status. However, among boys, fathers’ overparenting protect their shy sons from the risk of a low educational level for school problems. These findings highlight the relevance of considering the gender and surgency to a better understanding of the effects of contextual factors on children’s outcomes."

Current oral contraceptive use affects explicit and implicit measures of depression in women,18 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1462891/full,"Elizabeth Hampson, Sara N. Abrahamson, Taylor N. Breddy, Maisha Iqbal, Elena R. Wolff","Some data suggest that increased depressive symptoms may occur in women using combined oral contraceptives (OCs). However, this idea is controversial and the existing evidence is conflicting. The present study compared negative affect in 53 healthy women (Mage= 19.9 years) during intervals of active daily OC hormone intake and during the washout week of the contraceptive cycle when no exogenous estrogens or progestins are used. A prospective counterbalanced repeated-measures study design was employed. Depressive affect was evaluated using standard psychometric tests of explicit (self-perceived) and implicit negative affect. Implicit measures are considered less subject to bias related to social expectations, self-awareness, or willingness to disclose. Other than their usual OCs, participants were medication-free and had been using OCs for a median of 12 mo. We found that measures of implicit affect (e.g., Affect Misattribution Procedure, Emotional Stroop Test) displayed a more depressive-like pattern of performance during active hormone intake, particularly among a subgroup of OC users who reported experiencing high levels of depressive affect more generally. In contrast, participants’ self-perceptions suggested that they perceived their negative symptoms to be greater during the ‘off’ phase of the OC cycle, when OC steroids are withdrawn and menses occurs. The present findings reinforce the possibility of depressive mood effects associated with OC usage, and highlight the utility of including implicit measures, but also illustrate the complexity of mood assessment in OC users."

The purpose of the study was to understand how these psychological and organizational factors work together on teachers’ job involvement. Based on the questionnaire survey of 596 female teachers in primary schools, the data were collected and analyzed by AMOS software. The results show that professional commitment plays a central role in teachers’ job involvement, and self-efficacy and psychological resilience, as important psychological resources, significantly affect job involvement through the mediation of perceived organizational support. The model fitting indicators CFI, RMSEA and SRMR were in line with the acceptance criteria, which verified the adaptability of the hypothesis model. The findings not only reinforce the application of resource conservation theory in the field of education, but also provide school administrators with strategies to improve teachers’ job involvement, especially by enhancing the importance of organizational support and resilience. In addition, the results have practical implications for the design of targeted teacher professional development programs."

Twenty-four participants, selected through purposive sampling, completed surveys immediately after the workshop and 1 year later. Data were analyzed through both statistical and thematic approaches. A statistically significant decrease in the availability of “Flexibility and Mobility” was observed across all participants (p= 0.044) and a significant reduction in the availability of “Tolerance of Uncertainty” (p= 0.04) was noted among participants who engaged in network meetings over the course of 1 year. Qualitative analysis revealed that participants initially felt ambivalent toward OD due to systemic, cultural, and professional challenges. However, through experiential learning, their ambivalence shifted to hope, fostering solidarity and a more positive outlook for future OD practice. Participants recognized that implementing OD supported human rights, while addressing personal, organizational, and policy challenges. The findings provide important insights for developing OD training and implementation guidelines in South Korea. Recommendations include focusing on experiential learning and selecting mixed-group trainees from catchment area institutions, emphasizing the support of client rights, and considering individual, organizational, and systemic levels for successful implementation. This study represents a new case of OD dissemination through a top-down national research and development project and its integration into the WHO QualityRights service package, suggesting complementary potential between OD and global human rights-based mental health initiatives."

This study explored how CAs view the impact of the 4IR on their profession, focusing on the shifting roles, competencies, and challenges they face during this transitional period. The research adopted a qualitative approach to data collecting, including 14 semi-structured interviews with participants from various CA backgrounds. This research provides a thorough knowledge of the 4IR’s consequences for the profession and the perceptions of CA’s of the 4IR. Rapid task automation via technologies such as AI is posing a challenge to traditional CA roles, forcing a change towards more analytical thinking and strategic insight. CAs need to develop critical thinking abilities and data analysis ability. Older generations might need support to adapt to the technological changes. Despite fears about job loss due to technology, members were largely optimistic about the 4IR’s professional development potential. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations are given."
Th.o.m.a.s.: new insights into theory of mind in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,17 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1461980/full,"Roberta Fadda, Sara Congiu, Giuseppe Doneddu, Marinella Carta, Francesco Piras, Ilaria Gabbatore, Francesca M. Bosco","Previous studies indicated atypical Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at different ages. However, research focused on adolescents with ASD is still rare. This study aims to fill the gaps in the literature, by investigating ToM abilities in adolescents with ASD and in a group of typically developing ones. We applied the Theory of Mind Assessment Scale (Th.o.m.a.s.), a semi-structured interview that allows a multi-dimensional measurement of ToM, including different perspectives (first/s-order, first/third-person, egocentric/allocentric), various mental states (emotions, desires, beliefs) and metacognitive abilities related with mental states (awareness, relation, and strategies). The results indicated that ToM develops atypically in ASD, with strengths and weaknesses. First, participants with ASD were comparable to controls in some specific ToM aspects, i.e., third-person ToM, both from an egocentric and an allocentric perspective. However, they were significantly weaker in attributing an understanding of the mental states of others, both in first- and second-order ToM scenarios. Second, they showed the same level of awareness about mental states as controls, but they were significantly weaker in conceptualizing the relationship between mental states and behavior. Also, they found it very difficult to think about possible strategies that they or others might employ to realize desires and needs. Finally, they performed similarly to controls in understanding emotions, while they poorly understood desires and beliefs. These results point out the distinctive characteristics of ToM development in individuals with ASD, with important implications for individualized interventions."

Studies show that the art of living, described as the ability to lead a conscious and reflective life, can be learned and trained. The question arises as to what role the development of “art of living skills” have played in the treatment of depressed patients to date, and to what extent the targeted promotion of art of living within the framework of the therapy of depressed patients has an effect on the well-being and the level of depression that goes beyond this. The study is based on a mixed design. Study participants in the first experimental group (EG1,n= 53) each received one session of 50 min psychotherapy per week for 4 weeks. The second experimental group (EG2,n= 54) received psychotherapy equivalent to EG1 with additional life-skills reflection questions, which were to be answered every day and recorded in a diary. The control group (n= 53) received neither therapy nor reflection questions. The art of living, degree of depression, and satisfaction with life were assessed before and after the 4-week therapy and in the follow-up after 3 months, and the effects were compared. There was a significant decrease in the depression score over the 4 weeks in both therapy groups. EG2 showed a greater decrease in depression over the 4 weeks. However, the difference did not persist over the 3 months. Furthermore, in EG2 there was a significant increase in the Art of Living, Satisfaction with life, and Flourishing Scale over the 4 weeks, while in EG1 there was no change. However, the comparison in the follow-up after 3 months also shows that these effects could not stabilize. Overall, the results provide promising indications for integrating the art of living as a concept more strongly into the therapy of depressive patients. The question arises as to what long-term effects result from additional life skills stimulation and how the therapy effects gained can be stabilized over a longer period of time."
Refugees’ integration and emotional distress over the course of 9 months,17 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1459934/full,"Flurina Potter, Katalin Dohrmann, Brigitte Rockstroh, Anselm Crombach,","Background:High prevalence rates of mental disorders are reported in refugees due to experiencing substantial pre-, peri-, and post-migration stress. While long-term studies indicated that emotional distress of refugees either stagnates or ameliorates over time, long-term research on refugees’ integration and its’ interaction with emotional distress is limited. The examined long-term predictors for refugees’ emotional distress and integration in this study were, amongst others, severe physical abuse in childhood, residence status and length of stay."

Evolutionary development of mother–child scaffolding for moral comprehension,16 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1397547/full,Robert J. Beck,"This evolutionary developmental study employed an experimental recursive narrative ecological niche, comparing scaffolded mother–child (5-year-old) pairs to unassisted controls as they independently viewed and discussed a realistic fictional family video depicting a father–daughter emotional conflict over the girl’s risky behavior, which violated harm/care and fairness/justice moral foundation norms. A microgenetic analysis was conducted on a selected variant pair that demonstrated high adaptive fitness in the niche by employing developmentally advanced cooperative scaffolding tools. The conversational ecosystem phase was characterized by repeated maternal theory-oriented “why” questions and coordinated child causal responses, forming a joint epistemic investigation that facilitated the child’s moral understanding of the characters’ responsibilities and motives. The pair used quasi-justice procedures to gather evidence, judge, and construct moral attributes for the characters. Their conversational mechanism was supported by mutual mindreading, mental time travel, and empathic communications, as they interacted simultaneously with each other and the story characters. A narrative ecological scaffolding theory emerged, establishing a standard for cooperative epistemic scaffolding between the mother and the child. Future training programs should utilize the Zone of Proximal Development method to instruct similar parent–child pairs."

How life circumstances during public health crises affect people to share and correct misinformation: a perspective of the third-person effect,16 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1418504/full,Xiang Tian,"Introduction:Misinformation spreading on social media often parallels public crises, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, because people’s behaviors regarding misinformation may be influenced by their typical life circumstances. With the increasing severity of living conditions, misinformation is believed to spread more widely, while corrective behaviors tend to decrease. Furthermore, social comparison also affects the perception of life circumstances and subsequent behaviors. Taking Shanghai’s COVID-19 lockdown as an example, this study examined whether two representative factors—the duration of the lockdown and the satisfaction with relief measures—affected people’s tendency to share and correct misinformation. By employing the third-person effect (TPE) theory, the underlying mechanisms of social comparison were also explored."

While current mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are usually rooted in Asian contemplative traditions, mindfulness practices can equally be found in other knowledge systems, including integrative medicine systems such as anthroposophic medicine (AM). TheActivity-Based Stress Release(ABSR) program incorporates the latter as part of an 8-week-long online intervention combining mindfulness exercises, behavioral self-observation, and mindful movement practices derived from this integrative medicine frame. The program could offer additional means for cultivating mindfulness, thereby addressing the necessity for diverse approaches in conjunction with individual differences, diverse clinical demands, or restricted capacities to perform certain mindfulness practices. Using an observational repeated-measures design, the current study aimed to assess a large-scale online implementation of this program in terms of its feasibility, assessing perceived stress and mindfulness."

Díez-Álamo, María A. Alonso, Dominika Z. Wojcik, Angel Fernandez","This study investigated the transparency and translucency of 1,525 pictograms from the Aragonese Portal of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ARASAAC). A total of 521 participants took part in tasks that involved providing the word that best described the meaning of a pictogram or rating the relationship between a pictogram and a verbal label. This process allowed us to obtain indices of transparency (the quality of pictograms that makes their meaning easily “guessable” in the absence of their referent) and translucency (the degree of perceived relationship between the pictogram and its referent when the latter is present) which were further analyzed to assess their reliability and comparability with similar studies. Additionally, the relationship of those indices with various visual and psycholinguistic characteristics was explored, particularly focusing on the match between the original ARASAAC pictogram names and the most frequently provided names by the participants (modal names) for the pictograms. Results showed relatively low levels of transparency, as well as high levels of translucency, with nouns displaying the highest values in both metrics. For transparency and translucency, word imageability and concreteness were the most correlated factors, and, together with age of acquisition, they were the most important features related to the name matching with ARASAAC. The norms derived from this study enhance our understanding of pictogram perception, empowering stakeholders to leverage data-driven insights for the development and implementation of pictographic systems, thus improving cognitive accessibility."

To save the saver: facilitating school counselors’ occupational well-being through multi-dimensional support and basic psychological needs,11 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1475931/full,"Lina Feng, Yi Liu, Haoyan Huang","School counselors play an increasingly crucial role in protecting students’ mental health. However, many of them have experienced poor well-being in their occupations, which undermines their efficacy in mental protection. To identify the most significant well-being facilitators, this study examined associations between school counselors’ occupational well-being and situational, inter-individual and intra-individual supports, as well as further explored their dynamics. A total of 1,443 Chinese school counselors (66.6% part-time) from a regionally representative dataset were selected, and their work engagement, pressure and satisfaction were surveyed as well-being indicators. Dominance analysis revealed that (1) organizational support and occupational empowerment were consistently robust facilitators for most psychological needs and well-being indicators, (2) students were the most critical supporters for occupational well-being, particularly for part-time counselors; and (3) autonomy and competence were more central needs than relatedness in transferring supports to occupational well-being. Findings implied the most effective strategies to benefit school counselors’ occupational well-being, both in general and across different work cohorts."
The effect of grit on L2 willingness to communicate among Chinese junior high school students: an analysis of the differential roles of foreign language enjoyment and anxiety,11 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1468464/full,Gengchun Li,"With the burgeoning research on positive psychology, grit has gradually attracted scholarly attention in the field of L2 acquisition, and it has been shown to be a significant positive predictor of L2 achievements and outcomes. However, despite being an important factor in L2 acquisition, grit has rarely been incorporated as a research variable in prior research on willingness to communicate in a second language (L2 WTC), especially among Chinese teenagers who find themselves in a foundational stage of developing their L2 communicative competence. Based on a survey among 238 Chinese junior high school students, this study analyzed the effect of their grit on their L2 WTC, and explored the differential roles of foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and anxiety (FLA) in their interactions. The results revealed that: (1) perseverance of effort (PE), consistency of interest (CI) and FLE had significantly positive correlations with L2 WTC, whereas FLA was found to have a significantly negative correlation with L2 WTC; (2) PE and CI served as significant positive predictors of L2 WTC; (3) FLE mediated the interactions between PE and L2 WTC and between CI and L2 WTC, while the mediating effects of FLA were found to be statistically non-significant. The findings can provide theoretical implications for furthering L2 WTC research, as well as practical reference for its development among Chinese junior high school students."
Primus inter pares effect in high schools,11 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1382062/full,"Denis Dizdarević, Robert Leskovar, Goran Vukovič","Primus inter pareseffect or better-than-average effect is cognitive bias known as illusory superiority in which individuals overestimate their positive abilities and traits in comparison to others. Overestimation and bias are often accompanied with various dangers on a personal, organizational or even societal level. We investigated the presence of overestimation among high school graduates in Slovenia in areas of teamwork, interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, problem solving, and decision making. Although overestimation was present in all areas, results have also shown indications of indecisiveness. Overestimation was highest in the area of interpersonal skills, which is more of a social skill area in comparison with decision making or problem solving. Individuals probably receive more feedback over the course of high school in decision making, problem solving, and teamwork than in interpersonal skills, as those can directly impact grades while interpersonal skills less so."
Exploring career interest and STEM self-efficacy: implications for promoting gender equity,11 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1402933/full,"Niam Yamani, Hiya Almazroa","This study explores the relationship between career interests and self-efficacy in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) among young girls in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Employing a quantitative research design with a correlational approach, we utilize the S-STEM survey to measure changes in students’ STEM subject efficacy and their interest in STEM careers. Our sample comprises 671 middle and high school female students from 49 schools, representing a diverse cross-section of the population. The findings indicate that female students exhibit high levels of STEM self-efficacy and have a strong preference for medicine as a career choice. While the overall interest in STEM careers among students is moderate, there are notable variations in interest across different STEM fields. Importantly, a positive and significant correlation was observed between female students’ interest in STEM careers and their self-efficacy in STEM. This research holds important implications for the promotion of STEM education and careers among female students. By recognizing the unique context of Saudi Arabia and the perspectives of young girls in Riyadh, this study offers a fresh perspective on the factors influencing STEM career aspirations and highlights the importance of fostering self-efficacy beliefs among female students."

Integrating basic human values with forest ecosystem services: pathways to sustainable forest management,09 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1444775/full,"Darja Kobal Grum, Andrej Bončina","The article explores the intricate relationship between basic human values and forest ecosystem services (FES). The study highlights the critical role that forests play in providing essential services for biodiversity, forest products, climate stabilization and human well-being, and emphasizes the need to understand and integrate human values into forest management and planning. Through a novel approach, this study explores how the concept of “forest” can elicit considerations of fundamental human values that diverge from conventional classifications and measurements of forest values. The study uses a comprehensive methodology, including surveys and content analysis, to uncover the hierarchical structure of human values associated with forests. This approach enables the identification of fundamental values that remain constant despite situational variations. The main results reveal a hierarchical structure of values, with Apollonian values being more prevalent than Dionysian ones. The study shows significant differences in the importance attributed to different FES, reflecting underlying value differences between residents. The study makes a novel contribution by systematically examining the links between human values and FES and proposing a profound and sustainable approach to forest management that takes into account the psychological dimensions of human-forest interactions. The study suggests that recognizing and incorporating the intrinsic human values into forest ecosystem service frameworks can improve sustainable forest management practices and ultimately foster a deeper connection between people and the forest environment."

Previous research has examined recommendation systems that use mutual friend metrics, but few scholars have studied how the existence of features related to mutual friends affects users in SNSs. To explore this issue further, we conducted interviews with 22 users of WeChat Moments to investigate how certain rules involving mutual friends affect users and how they deal with the issues that arise due to these rules. We found that the three Moments rules related to mutual friends (response visibility, response notifications, and information dissemination) can cause users to feel jealous, annoyed, and embarrassed. To prevent these negative experiences, users may reduce the amount of information they disclose or the frequency of their interactions in SNSs. Based on these findings, we propose several future directions for scholars and a small number of design suggestions aimed at assisting providers to satisfy users’ interaction needs."

Although about 80% of online consumers intends to purchase after adding products to their shopping cart, the abandonment rate of cart products has been up to 70%. It is important to understand how to improve consumer attitude toward product both before and after cart use. Building on the relevant literature and the consumer shopping goal stages theory, this study aims to examine the effects of product price, as one of the most indispensable and important information in online shopping, on consumer attitudes toward product at different decision-making stages in online shopping (i.e., add-to-cart stage and place-an-order stage), and the mediating roles of perceived product quality and monetary sacrifice. The findings from behavioral experiment suggest that high price leads to a more positive attitude toward product at add-to-cart stage by strengthened perception of high product quality, while results in a less positive product attitude at place-an-order stage because of the enhanced perception of monetary sacrifice. Both theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed."
Exploring the role of identity in pro-environmental behavior: cultural and educational influences on younger generations,09 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1459165/full,"Steffen Wild, Lydia Schulze Heuling","It is of paramount importance to gain an understanding of pro-environmental behavior if we are to successfully tackle the climate crisis. The existing body of research provides evidence that identity influences pro-environmental behavior. However, such research is often over-generalised and researchers are challenged to conduct robust analyses with regard to specific local, cultural and educational factors. The present study aims to investigate whether personal or social identity has a distinct effect on three different dimensions of pro-environmental behavior, using the principles of self-categorisation theory. Additionally, the study seeks to determine whether one of these two factors, the individual or the social factor, is predominant over the other. The study group consisted of cooperative students in Germany, typically a group with high professional ambitions. The data was collected in a cross-sectional survey with a total of 568 cooperative students from academic disciplines in engineering and economics. The reliability of the scales is satisfactory (ω = 0.76–0.88), and the hypotheses are tested by estimating structural equation models. Our research demonstrates that while social identity exerts a stronger influence on activist behavior than personal identity, personal identity has a more pronounced effect on consumer behavior than social identity. Nevertheless, no general statement can be made regarding the relative strength of the effects of personal and social identity on pro-environmental behavior dimensions."

First, we present prominent theoretical frameworks to analyze reflective writings. Second, we review relevant methodological approaches of research on reflective writings in teacher education, such as qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods. Third, we present a study from our research lab combining qualitative content analysis and linguistic analyses as an example for a concurrent mixed method approach. The results of the qualitative content analysis indicated that 198 reflective writings of pre-service teachers were primarily descriptive and on a low level. Computational linguistic analyses revealed that affective and cognitive terminology utilization in reflective writing differed significantly across the different levels of reflection, with a higher frequency of such terms correlating with deeper levels of reflection. Thus, essential challenges and opportunities of implementing such a mixed method study to analyze reflective writings are illustrated and discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing on how mixed methods approaches might be further advanced in the field of reflective writing research in teacher education."

An intrinsic relationship between the basic acoustic property (physics) of music and human emotional response (physiology) to the music is suggested, which can be statistically modeled and explained by using a novel notion termed as quantitative physics–physiology relationship (QPPR). Here, we systematically analyzed the complex response profile of people to traditional/ancient music in the Shu area, a geographical concept located in the Southwest China and one of three major origins of the Chinese nation. Chill was utilized as an indicator to characterize the response strength of 18 subjects to an in-house compiled repertoire of 86 music samples, consequently creating a systematic subject-to-sample response (SSTSR) profile consisting of 1,548 (18 × 86) paired chill elements. The multivariate statistical correlation of measured chill values with acoustic features and personal attributes was modeled by using random forest (RF) regression in a supervised manner, which was compared with linear partial least square (PLS) and non-linear support vector machine (SVM). The RF model exhibits possessed strong fitting ability (rF2= 0.857), good generalization capability (rP2= 0.712), and out-of-bag (OOB) predictability (rO2= 0.731) as compared to SVM and, particularly, PLS, suggesting that the RF-based QPPR approach is able to explain and predict the emotional change upon musical arousal. It is imparted that there is an underlying relationship between the acoustic physical property of music and the physiological reaction of the audience listening to the music, in which therhythmcontributes significantly to emotional response relative totimbreandpitch.

The effect of augmented reality storybooks on the story comprehension and retelling of preschool children,08 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1459264/full,Emine Ela Şimşek,"This study aimed to compare the retelling and story comprehension performance of two groups of preschool children—an experimental and a control group—who experienced printed and augmented reality storybooks. The participant group consisted of 90 participants, with 45 in the experimental group (22 girls, 23 boys) and 45 in the control group (21 girls, 24 boys). The average age of the children was 54.2 months. In the study, the researcher evaluated children’s story-retelling performance using the rubric and used a Story Comprehension Test to measure their story comprehension performance. The researchers utilized the ROAR application to incorporate augmented reality content into the books. In the pre-test phase, the teachers read the designated texts to the children in the experimental and control groups. After the eight-week break, the control group experienced the same texts with printed books, while the experimental group experienced them with augmented reality support. Each child participated individually in the reading process with the teacher. In the study, teachers asked the children to retell the story and asked the questions from the Story Comprehension Test at the end of each book reading section for pre-test and post-test measurements. The pre-test results revealed no significant difference in the two groups’ story-retelling and Story Comprehension Test scores. The post-test results indicated a significant difference in the story-retelling performance and Story Comprehension Test scores between the experimental and control groups, favoring the experimental group. Based on these findings, the augmented reality content can potentially enhance children’s retelling and story comprehension performances."

Predicting subjective ratings of affect and comprehensibility with text features: a reader response study of narrative poetry,08 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1431764/full,"Mesian Tilmatine, Jana Lüdtke, Arthur M. Jacobs,","Literary reading is an interactive process between a reader and a text that depends on a balance between cognitive effort and emotional rewards. By studying both the crucial features of the text and of the subjective reader reception, a better understanding of this interactive process can be reached. In the present study, subjects (N=31) read and rated a work of narrative fiction that was written in a poetic style, thereby offering the readers two pathways to cognitive rewards: Aesthetic appreciation and narrative immersion. Using purely text-based quantitative descriptors, we were able to independently and accurately predict the subjective ratings in the dimensions comprehensibility, valence, arousal, and liking across roughly 140 pages of naturalistic text. The specific text features that were most important in predicting each rating dimension are discussed in detail. In addition, the implications of the findings are discussed more generally in the context of existing models of literary processing and future research avenues for empirical literary studies."

Emotion topology: extracting fundamental components of emotions from text using word embeddings,08 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1401084/full,"Hubert Plisiecki, Adam Sobieszek","This exploratory study examined the potential of word embeddings, an automated numerical representation of written text, as a novel method for emotion decomposition analysis. Drawing from a substantial dataset scraped from a Social Media site, we constructed emotion vectors to extract the dimensions of emotions, as annotated by the readers of the texts, directly from human language. Our findings demonstrated that word embeddings yield emotional components akin to those found in previous literature, offering an alternative perspective not bounded by theoretical presuppositions, as well as showing that the dimensional structure of emotions is reflected in the semantic structure of their text-based expressions. Our study highlights word embeddings as a promising tool for uncovering the nuances of human emotions and comments on the potential of this approach for other psychological domains, providing a basis for future studies. The exploratory nature of this research paves the way for further development and refinement of this method, promising to enrich our understanding of emotional constructs and psychological phenomena in a more ecologically valid and data-driven manner."

Interoceptive sensibility and alcohol craving in Polish prisoners: the role of alexithymia and emotional dysregulation,07 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1356024/full,"Dawid Konrad Ścigała, Matteo Angelo Fabris, Elżbieta Zdankiewicz-Ścigała, Krystian Kuc, Claudio Longobardi, ","Introduction:Alcohol craving, characterized by a strong desire or compulsion to consume alcohol, is a prominent symptom of substance dependence syndrome. Research indicates that alcohol craving is a significant factor leading to the termination of abstinence. The mechanisms underlying the activation of alcohol craving remain not fully understood. The urge to reach for alcohol may be stimulated by emotions, memories, thoughts, or bodily sensations, as well as external factors. It has been postulated that individuals with high levels of interoceptive sensibility tend to exhibit a high degree of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation in the context of alcohol craving. Deficits in identifying and verbalizing emotions, along with an operational thinking style, facilitate alcohol consumption by impeding accurate insight into one’s mental state, thereby hindering the comprehension of bodily states, emotions, and the regulation of self."

An empirical study on the relationship between emotional labor and work performance among university teachers,07 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1470436/full,Danna Hao,"This study is based on the theory of emotional events and explores the relationship between emotional labor and the job performance of university teachers. Relevant data was obtained through a questionnaire, and a structural equation model was constructed for path analysis. The study found that the surface performance of university teachers has a significant negative impact on relationship performance and task performance; deep performance and proactive authenticity of university teachers have a significant positive impact on relationship performance, task performance, and adaptability performance, respectively; the passive reality of university teachers has a significant negative impact on relationship performance, task performance, and adaptability performance. Based on research findings, this study proposes suggestions for the performance evaluation mechanism of university teachers, including improving the recruitment methods, increasing the emotional labor assessment and incentive mechanism, focusing on alleviating negative emotions of teachers, strengthening the awareness guidance and education of school management and teachers on emotional labor, establishing training courses on emotional labor for teachers, arranging various activities reasonably, and creating a good working atmosphere. Ultimately, these suggestions aim to help university teachers recognize the significance of emotional labor, promote their educational and teaching work, and provide new methods and paths for improving the work performance of university teachers."
Influence of parental structure and chaos on homework anxiety in elementary school students: the mediating role of homework motivation,07 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1399507/full,"Jing Li, Yadong Ding","The present study aimed to examine the relationship between parental structure, parental chaos, and homework anxiety among elementary school students, as well as the mediating roles of autonomous and controlled motivation in relation to homework. A total of 1,118 elementary school students from grades 4 to 6 completed the Parents as Social Context Questionnaire, Homework Anxiety Scale, and Homework Motivation Scale. Results indicated that parental structure was negatively associated with homework anxiety in elementary school students, while parental chaos exhibited a positive correlation with such anxiety; furthermore, both homework autonomous and controlled motivation mediated the relationship between parental structure and chaos with homework anxiety. Specifically, a structured parenting environment could mitigate homework anxiety by enhancing students’ autonomous motivation; conversely, chaotic parenting environments were associated with increased homework anxiety through heightened controlled motivation while simultaneously diminishing autonomous motivation. These findings offer novel insights into alleviating homework-related anxiety among elementary school students and provide empirical support for developing educational interventions focused on parenting practices."

Is phenomenal consciousness really a special case in science?,04 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1422050/full,"Klaus Gärtner, João L. Cordovil,","In the metaphysics of science, it is often held that higher-level properties are grounded in micro-physical properties. According to many philosophers, however, phenomenal consciousness resists this view. Many famous arguments in Philosophy of Mind have been given to reject this notion. In this paper, we argue that there is something odd about the idea that phenomenal consciousness is a special case in science and give a constructive proposal on how consciousness can fit in the natural world. To do so, we will first introduce a general notion of what grounding is. Then, we will briefly explain how the arguments for the specialness of phenomenal consciousness work by considering two famous examples, namely the zombie and the knowledge argument. In a further step, we will briefly discuss two cases from other areas in science, i.e., in particle physics and chemistry. We will demonstrate that the standard view about the reductive relation does not hold, even in these paradigm cases of the natural sciences. If what we argue is true, we think that most arguments from phenomenal consciousness cannot defeat physicalismper se. Finally, we will introduce an alternative way to naturalize phenomenal consciousness."
"Father presence, adolescent girls’ resilience, psychological security, and achievement goal orientation: examining direct and indirect associations",04 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1403403/full,"Jiayi Zhou, Xueyan Wei, Lingfang Xue, ","In the developmental research, studies on the importance of fathers in the parent–child relationship is insufficient, especially the father-daughter relationship. Thus far, a few studies have investigated whether father presence influences adolescent daughters’ resilience. Therefore, this study investigated the extent to which intermediary factors affect the relationship between father presence and daughters’ resilience. A total of 718 Chinese female high school students participated in a questionnaire survey. The results showed father presence was positively related to resilience in female high school students. Additionally, psychological security fully mediated the relationship between father presence and daughters’ resilience, whereas achievement goal orientation partially mediated this relationship; specifically, the mastery-approach and performance-approach orientations. The results highlight the importance of considering the meaning and implications of father presence and daughter’s resilience in Chinese culture."
Stress and career aspirations: a longitudinal study with medical students,04 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1449111/full,"Clara Picker-Roesch, Jessica Lang","Background:The psychological well-being of medical students has often been studied in relation to various factors and typically exhibits poorer scores than comparable student groups. This diminished well-being can have far-reaching implications, like impact on career or academic engagement. While there are some studies on specialty choice or academic performance few studies have examined the effects of stress at the beginning of medical school on career ambitions and the associated interest in research. Given the anticipated future shortage of healthcare professionals and the goal of gender equality in higher positions, it is crucial to examine this relationship as early as medical education. The question arises whether medical education and the demands of studying influence the career ambitions of different student groups."
The mediating role of school effectiveness in the relationship between transformational leadership and workplace exclusion,04 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1475156/full,Ayhan Kandemir,"The purpose of this study is to reveal the mediating role of school effectiveness in the relationship between transformational leadership and workplace exclusion.

In the context of the results, suggestions were made such as providing in-service courses for school administrators on transformational leadership and school effectiveness, preventing exclusion at work by giving teachers the opportunity to develop themselves and participate in the decisions taken."
Delayed predictive inference integration with and revision by low-competitive inference alternatives in Chinese narrative text reading,04 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1403479/full,"Fei Xu, Lulu Cheng, Xianghong Gong, Chenglong Liu","When readers encounter information conflicting with the predictive inferences made earlier, they may update the outdated ones with new ones, a process known as predictive inference revision. The current study examined the revision of disconfirmed predictive inferences by the primarily weakly activated, thus low-competitive inference alternatives during Chinese narrative text reading among Chinese native speakers. We conducted an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment to study the predictive inference revision with increasingly supportive information for the low-competitive predictive inference alternatives. It serves as the very first attempts to study the predictive inference revision mechanisms by combining a larger range of ERP components, including frontal-Post-N400-Positivity (f-PNP) as an index of revision to examine the influences of the alternative inferences at later stages of reading comprehension. Our results showed that readers could detect inconsistent information (P300), disconfirm the incorrect predictive inferences before successfully integrating the low-competitive alternative predictive inferences with their current situation model (N400), engaging themselves in a second-pass reanalysis process incurring processing costs (P600), and revising the disconfirmed predictive inferences (f-PNP) at a later stage of reading comprehension. Results of this study are supportive of relevant theories in assuming that predictive inference revision does not happen immediately upon encountering conflicting information but happens slowly and incrementally. Our results also unfold the post-revision mechanisms by suggesting the remaining activation and lingering influences of the disconfirmed inferences in the forthcoming reading process."

The study employed a descriptive survey model, a quantitative research approach. Participants were selected using criterion sampling, a purposeful sampling technique. The study sample included 305 mothers and 209 fathers with infants aged 0–24 months, who are married, living together, and agreed to participate. The data in the study were collected with the “Demographic Information Form” and “Maternal Gatekeeping Scale” created by the researcher. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed for the construct validity of the Maternal Gatekeeping Scale- Mother Form and Maternal Gatekeeping Scale- Father Form. The internal consistency reliability coefficient of the Maternal Gatekeeping Scale-Mother Form was 0.76; the control sub-dimension was 0.75, the encouragement sub-dimension was 0.81, and the obstacle sub-dimension was 0.76. The internal consistency reliability coefficient of the Maternal Gatekeeping Scale-Father Form was 0.87; the control sub-dimension was 0.83, the encouragement sub-dimension was 0.87, and the obstacle sub-dimension was 0.87. In order to calculate item discriminations, 27% lower-upper groups were formed and independent sample t-test was applied to these groups. Item-total correlation values were calculated to determine the relationship between each item in the scale and other items. The findings of this study demonstrate that both the Mother and Father Forms of the Maternal Gatekeeping Scale are valid and reliable tools for assessing maternal gatekeeping among parents with infants in Türkiye. The adaptation of this scale represents a significant advancement in the field of maternal gatekeeping during infancy. It is anticipated that this adapted scale will serve as a foundational resource for future research, facilitating the exploration of determinants and consequences associated with maternal gatekeeping in infancy."

Digital technology and psychological happiness: the mediating roles of interpersonal relationships and employment situations,02 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1420511/full,"Wenxin Hu, Ziwen Zhang, Xinyue Qu, Yufei Mao","Psychological happiness represents the ultimate pursuit of human beings, and the impact of digital technology on psychological happiness is becoming increasingly significant in the era of the digital economy. Based on data from 2020 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this study constructs an empirical model that examines the effect and mechanism of digital technology on happiness. Additionally, this study investigates the heterogeneity and robustness of the impact of digital technology on happiness. The research conclusions are as follows: Firstly, digital technology can promote psychological happiness. When controlling for other factors, the marginal effect coefficient of digital technology is 0.031. Secondly, the effect of digital technology on personal happiness varies among different groups, particularly among women, young individuals, primary and college graduates, and rural residents. Furthermore, as absolute income increases, the happiness effect of digital technology diminishes. Thirdly, in terms of the influencing mechanism, digital technology indirectly affects individual happiness by influencing health status, interpersonal relationships, employment situations and income levels. Specifically, digital technology negatively impacts personal health, interpersonal relationships, and agricultural work, while positively impacting family relationships, non-agricultural employment, absolute income and relative income. Digital technology affects happiness through these channels indirectly. Based on the study results, it is proposed that efforts should be made to enhance the development of digital technology infrastructure in remote rural areas, reduce the financial burden associated with digital technology, and promote the digital technology ecosystem. Moreover, providing online services, such as e-commerce, travel reservations, and digital financial management, can improve access to digital technology in rural areas and contribute to increased happiness levels. Simultaneously, there is a need to strengthen digital skills training, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and rural residents, to improve their proficiency in digital technologies. This can be achieved through the integration of additional educational resources, thereby facilitating cost-free digital technology training and guidance. Meanwhile, it is essential to vigorously develop the new economy and innovative employment models, create job opportunities, foster entrepreneurial prospects, and improve income levels to enhance individual well-being."

Here, we examine an aspect of this effect that has gone relatively unnoticed: the impact of deviant sounds is stronger for response repetitions than for response switches. Our approach was two-fold. First, we carried out a simulation to estimate the likelihood that stimuli sequences used in past work may not have used balanced proportions of response repetition and switch trials. More specifically, we sought to determine whether the larger distraction effect for response repetitions may have reflected a rarer, and thereby more surprising, occurrence of such trials. To do so, we simulated 10,000 stimuli sets for a 2-AFC task with a proportion of deviant trial of 0.1 or 0.16. Second, we carried out a 2-AFC oddball task in which participants judged the duration of a tone (short vs. long). We carefully controlled the sequence of stimuli to ensure to balance the proportions of response repetitions and response switches across the standard and deviant conditions. The results of the stimuli simulation showed that, contrary to our concerns, response switches were more likely than response repetitions when left uncontrolled for. This suggests that the larger distraction found for response repetition in past work may in fact have been underestimated. In the tone duration judgment task, the results showed a large impact of the response type on distraction as measured by response times: Deviants sounds significantly delayed response repetitions but notably accelerated switches. These findings suggest that deviant sound hinder response repetition and encourage or bias the cognitive system towards a change of responses. We discuss these findings in relation to the adaptive nature of the involuntary detection of unexpected stimuli and in relation to the notion of partial repetition costs. We argue that results are in line with the binding account as well as with the signaling theory."

Patient characteristics of completion and dropout of mentalization-based treatment for adolescents with conduct disorder,02 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1390169/full,"Sophie Hauschild, Drago Dragovic, Lea Kasper, Esther Sobanski, Svenja Taubner,","Introduction:Conduct disorder (CD) is a severe mental disorder in youth. Yet, providing psychological interventions for adolescents with CD is challenging. This patient group is often characterized by risk factors for therapy dropout such as, e.g., CD symptoms and being in middle adolescence. On the other hand, little is known about characteristics of adolescents with CD who complete treatment. To gain more insight into what might become a successful therapy with adolescents with CD, this study explores baseline characteristics and drop-out occurrence in patients with CD referred to mentalization-based treatment for adolescents with CD (MBT-CD). More specifically, this study aims at identifying clusters of adolescent patients based on age, CD symptom severity and personality pathology at the beginning of treatment which may have come along with a higher or lower dropout occurrence."

Implicit motor imagery: examining motor vs. visual strategies in laterality judgments among older adults,02 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1445152/full,"Aneet Saran, Jonathan J. Marotta","Cognitive states like motor imagery (MI; simulating actions without overtly executing them) share a close correspondence with action execution, and hence, activate the motor system in a similar way. However, as people age, reduction in specific cognitive abilities like motor action simulation and action planning/prediction are commonly experienced. The present study examined the effect of visual–spatial processing for both typical and challenging upper-limb movements using the Hand Laterality Judgment Task (HLJT), in which participants were asked to judge whether the depicted hand is a left or right hand. Several main findings emerged: (1) Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited slower responses and greater error rates in both Experiment 1 and 2. This suggests that visual–spatial transformations undergo alterations with age; (2) Older adults displayed higher error rates with realistic hands at both back and palm viewpoints of the hands compared to younger adults. However, this pattern did not hold for response times; (3) Participants responded faster to medial hand orientations (i.e., closer to the midline of the body) compared to lateral hand orientations (i.e., farther from the midline of the body) for palm-views in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Given that we observed better performance on medial orientations compared to lateral orientations, this suggests that participants follow the same motor rules and biomechanical constraints of the represented movement. Novel information is provided about differences in individuals’ use of strategies (visual vs. motor imagery) to solve the HLJT for both mannequin and real hands."

Mobile phone dependence among Chinese university students: the contribution of irrational beliefs and solitude,01 Oct 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1453961/full,"Xiaoxue Kuang, Kerry John Kennedy, Hui Li","This research aimed to explore the impact of selected psychological variables on mobile phone dependence among Chinese university students. Specifically, the study focused on the relationship between solitude and irrational beliefs on mobile phone dependence. The study included 2,888 university students from Guangdong, Southern China, and found that both irrational beliefs and solitude had significant direct effects on mobile phone dependence. The study also revealed that solitude mediated the relationship between irrational beliefs and mobile phone dependence. The results of this study indicate that psychosocial environments, including feelings of solitude and irrational beliefs, can influence mobile phone dependence among undergraduate students. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to these factors and their potential impact on student behavior, particularly when it comes to academic growth and development. Further research in this area may help identify effective strategies to address mobile phone dependence among university students and promote healthier psychosocial environments."

C. Muhammadu Kijas","Gender prejudice and stereotypes are prevalent in the workplace, particularly for women in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry, where they can significantly hinder professional development and limit prospects for growth. These challenges contribute to the underrepresentation of executives in AI. However, with the right measures, these barriers can be overcome, leading to a more inclusive and diverse AI industry. Women in this demanding technological domain often face additional difficulties in achieving a work-life balance, further constraining their professional advancement and engagement in the industry. This research aims to examine the implications of AI capabilities on work-life balance and the empowerment of female faculty members in enhancing the efficiency of educational institutions. The research performs a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, using a survey conducted on female faculty of Saudi Arabian universities. The study specifically considers moderating variables such as age, education level, experience, and marital status. The findings, which reveal that AI managerial capability, as well as AI infrastructure agility, impacts work-life balance and empowerment of women faculties in educational institution efficiency, underscore the significance of considering demographic factors when analyzing women’s empowerment and work-life balance as outcomes. By exploring these factors, the research provides a comprehensive understanding of how AI capabilities impact women’s empowerment and their ability to maintain a work-life balance, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and effectiveness of educational institutions. These results emphasize the value of increasing women’s empowerment and raising the standard of performance evaluation systems in educational sectors."

Are all negative words alike? Behavioral differences in processing negative words associated and not associated with physical and social pain,30 Sep 2024,Original Research,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1474945/full,"Eleonora Borelli, Francesca Pesciarelli","Studies examining whether stimulus valence affects cognitive processing and motor responses yield mixed results, possibly due to treating negative words as a homogeneous category. Words related to pain may hold distinct status because of their relevance to survival. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to investigate semantic influences on cognitive processing. This study aims to determine if words related to physical and social pain elicit stronger aversion than general negative words by assessing the Affective Compatibility Effect in implicit and explicit tasks. In Experiment 1, 35 participants performed a lexical decision task on 60 positive words and 60 negative words, of which 20 not related to pain, 20 related to physical pain, and 20 related to social pain. Participants held down the central key of a keyboard and released it to press a key far from the screen (avoidance condition) or close to the screen (approach condition) for words. In Experiment 2, 43 participants performed a valence evaluation task on the same words. They held down the central key and released it to press a key close to the screen for positive words and a key far from the screen for negative words (congruent condition), or the opposite (incongruent condition). In Experiment 1, we found faster RTs for social pain-related words compared to other categories. We also found faster RTs in the approach condition than in the avoidance condition, regardless of whether valence or semantics were considered as independent variables. In Experiment 2, we found faster RTs in the congruent condition than in the incongruent condition when semantics was considered as independent variable. We also found an interaction valence*condition, with faster RTs for negative words in the congruent condition than in the incongruent condition when valence was considered as independent variable. Our findings suggest that, notwithstanding pain-related words do not affect aversive behaviors compared to negative, pain-unrelated words, they are processed faster when conveying social pain. This supports the hypothesis that the cognitive system differentiates and responds congruently not only based on general semantic categories, like pain, but also possibly based on nuances within it."
