Our study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of HADS in people with cancer.Methods: Our study was cross-sectional and non-probabilistic. It involved patients diagnosed with cancer, over years old, and were treated in a public institution specialized in cancer. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory were used. Internal structure, measurement invariance, relationship with other variables and reliability were evaluated.Results: It was found that HADS is best suited to a bifactorial structure where there is one general factor and two specific factors . HADS proves to be invariant according to sex and years of education. It is moderately related to Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Also, it presents acceptable levels of reliability and relationship with instruments used in the diagnosis of anxiety and depression.Conclusion: HADS is best suited to a bifactorial structure in a cancer population, comparisons can be made for both men and women and according to years of education. Its brevity, versatility, hospital-focused design and extensive study make HADS a very important instrument in the detection of anxiety and depression in cancer patients."

Beyond the illicit collection of personal information by others, the risk of privacy leakage also stems from users' own information-sharing behaviors. This study aims to construct a predictive model of factors influencing social media users' privacy disclosure behavior. Focusing on WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, this study collected , valid online questionnaires from users in mainland China. Through mediation and moderation analyses, our research reveals that users exhibit high levels of social overload and privacy fatigue. Privacy concern and privacy fatigue, as emotion-based coping mechanisms in response to potential privacy threats, are significantly influenced by cognitive factors such as perceived risk, social overload, and self-efficacy. These emotional states, in turn, affect users' privacy disclosure intentions and behaviors. Our findings offer insights into the cognitive factors impacting privacy disclosure and suggest approaches for enhancing users' privacy protection on social media platforms. Practical implications include recommendations for social media service providers to adopt more concise and efficient user privacy settings, thereby improving users' privacy management capabilities. Additionally, the study's results can inform policy-making and platform design, aiding in the development of effective privacy protection measures and policies."

It is of far-reaching significance to systematically investigate the relationship between them for carrying out scientific training and improving athletes' competitive level.This study aims to investigate the relationships among coach leadership behavior, the coach-athlete relationship, psychological fatigue, and athletes' performance, providing insights into enhancing athletes' sports performance.Using simple random sampling, athletes were recruited from professional training teams in the Xinjiang and Shanxi provinces of China as the study sample. The sample includes second-class national athletes, first-class national athletes, master-class athletes, and international-level athletes. Data were collected through offline surveys using the Coach Leadership Behavior Scale, the Tennis Performance Scale, the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire, and the Athlete Psychological Fatigue Questionnaire.) Democratic leadership behavior, autocratic leadership behavior, training and instruction behavior, social support behavior, and positive feedback behavior are positively correlated with the ""coach-athlete"" relationship and athlete performance, and negatively correlated with psychological fatigue.) The ""coach-athlete"" relationship and psychological fatigue can serve as both simple mediators and chain mediators between democratic leadership behavior, autocratic leadership behavior, training and instruction behavior, social support behavior, positive feedback behavior, and athlete performance.This study systematically explored the complex relationships among coach leadership behavior, the coach-athlete relationship, psychological fatigue, and athletes' sports performance. The findings suggest that positive coach leadership behavior may contribute to the development of athletes' performance.

This study addresses this gap by analyzing a bilingual corpus of texts written in Romanian and English across various disciplines and genres. It aims to uncover emotional dimensions conveyed through linguistic markers, exploring how language, culture, and academic context shape students’ writing styles. Romania’s historical and social emphasis on formality, hierarchy, and indirectness in communication serves as a backdrop for examining these dynamics.Method: A corpus-based approach was adopted, utilizing the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count tool to analyze linguistic and emotional markers. The bilingual ROGER corpus, containing texts from nine Romanian universities spanning multiple disciplines and genres, served as the dataset. Advanced data analysis techniques included supervised machine learning for language classification, network analysis to explore interactions among linguistic features, and cluster analysis to detect discipline- and genre-specific linguistic patterns.Results: The findings reveal distinct emotional patterns between Romanian and English academic writing. Romanian texts exhibit a higher degree of formality and indirectness, while English texts reflect greater assertiveness and personal engagement. Additionally, the Romanian corpus demonstrates less linguistic cohesion and a broader range of writing styles. Genre- and discipline-specific trends also emerge, with English coursework and analytical writing, predominantly from social sciences, displaying more personal and emotional expression than research-focused texts. In contrast, the Romanian corpus, characterized by a third cluster, presents less clear-cut patterns: humanities texts span both emotionally expressive and neutral tones, while research and academic papers frequently exhibit an achievement-oriented or entrepreneurial style, though a significant subset also reflects a highly disengaged profile. Discussion: By integrating machine learning, network analysis, and automatic language analysis, this study offers a novel perspective on how language, genre, and discipline-specific conventions shape emotional expression in academic writing. The results suggest that the Romanian students’ emotional personas in academic writing are influenced by all these factors, potentially shaped by the cultural norms of the second language, providing insights for teaching academic writing in multilingual settings."

Participants were trained to learn monosyllabic words and disyllabic phrases with their attention focused on a wordorder rule, while unknowingly being exposed to unfamiliar tone sandhi patterns. A judgment test with trial-to-trial confidence ratings was conducted to assess the learning outcomes and participants' awareness. Results revealed significantly abovechance performance on tone sandhi patterns for learned phrases. This learning effect was generalized to unseen phrases made up of familiar words, but not to phrases with new words, indicating a degree of abstraction across instances, though the learning is not fully rule-based. The confidence rating results suggest that participants were unaware of the structural sandhi knowledge, but the reaction time data of the judgment test indicate that the sandhi knowledge was learned with awareness at the level of noticing."

Investigations comparing steady-pitch vocalizations and non-steady-pitch vocalizations have revealed that the extent of compensation is task-dependent. Nevertheless, the influence of musical expertise and the preference for adopting opposing or following responses during glissando vocalizations remain unexplored. In this study, thirty-six native Mandarin speakers, comprising equal numbers of musicians and non-musicians, were asked to perform three vocal tasks. During the sustained vowel task, participants maintained a steady and comfortable pitch while vocalizing /a/ for three seconds. In the upward glissando and downward glissando tasks, participants imitated the gliding pattern of the model note introduced at the beginning of each trial. The onset of pitchshifted feedback occurred randomly between and ms after vocal onset, lasting for ms. Response proportions for opposing and following responses were estimated through Bayesian Poisson regression modeling, whereas response magnitudes were scrutinized using generalized additive mixed effects modeling. Our results revealed that opposing and following responses were less pronounced among musicians compared to non-musicians. Furthermore, following responses were not a minority in response to auditory perturbations; rather, they constituted % of the responses on average. Additionally, response magnitudes were found to be contextually sensitive and were influenced by the direction of the shift and the intended pitch direction."

It aims to understand how these factors influence perceived word-level prominence and focus assignment during listening.We present results of two listening tasks designed to examine the influence of pitch cues and constituent order on perceived word prominence and focus assignment during the auditory comprehension of SV[O]F and OV[S]F sentences in Russian. Our findings reveal an asymmetric pattern: monolingual speakers, as a baseline, tend to perceive the nuclear pitch-accented object as more prominent, particularly in the SVO order, whereas bilinguals appear to be less sensitive to the constituent order distinction.Additionally, baseline speakers consistently assign focus to the sentence-final nuclear pitch-accented noun regardless of constituent order. In contrast, bilinguals demonstrate a preference for assigning focus to the sentence-final nuclear-accented object, rather than the sentence-final nuclear-accented subject. A proficiency effect emerged indicative of a more target-like performance among bilinguals with greater proficiency in Russian."

Understanding these mechanisms allows for designing methods that synthesize images attenuating or enhancing selected emotional states, which may provide unobtrusive and widely-applicable treatment of mental dysfunctions and disorders.MethodsThe Convolutional Neural Network , a type of ANN used in computer vision tasks which models the ways humans solve visual tasks, was applied to synthesize images with no semantic content to maximize activations of neurons in precisely-selected layers in the CNN. The evoked emotions of human subjects observing these images were self-reported on a two-dimensional scale utilizing self-assessment manikin figures. Correlations between arousal and valence values and image visual properties as well as the position of the CNN's layers stimulated to obtain a given image were calculated.ResultsSynthesized images that maximized activations of some of the CNN layers led to significantly higher or lower arousal and valence levels compared to average subject's reactions. Multiple linear regression analysis found that a small set of selected image global visual features are significant predictors of the measured arousal, however no statistically significant dependencies were found between image global visual features and the measured valence.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that the specific method of synthesizing images by maximizing small and precisely-selected parts of the CNN used in this work may lead to synthesis of visual stimuli that enhance or attenuate emotional reactions. This method paves the way for developing tools that stimulate, in a non-invasive way, to support wellbeing and to assist patients with certain mental conditions by complementing traditional methods of therapeutic interventions."

However, its socio-pragmatic dynamics remain underexplored, particularly in cooperative interactions where social norms and economic considerations intersect.Objective: This study investigates the socio-behavioral dynamics of SDS, focusing on how children with the condition navigate cooperative interactions. Using computational pragmatics, we aimed to identify the underlying principles guiding their social behavior. Methods: A cohort of children participated in ecological and cognitive tasks, including the WISC-V ""Comprehension"" subtest, NEPSY-II social perception tasks, and the Trognon Ecological Side Task for the Assessment of Speech-Act Processing . Dialogues were analyzed using the Topological and Kinetic model and a Recurrent Neural Network , enabling fine-grained computational insights into their interaction patterns.Results: Children with SDS exhibited cooperative behaviors shaped by perceived economic benefits, often at the expense of established social norms. Unlike behaviors classically observed in other pathologies such as autism spectrum disorders, where responses are influenced by the directness of communication, SDS behaviors were driven by personal gain, regardless of the indirectness of requests. Computational analyses revealed strong divergences in dialogical alignment when tasks lacked direct benefits, even with corrective prompts.Insights from Computational Pragmatics Conclusions: SDS children demonstrate a transactional approach to social interactions, prioritizing personal benefits over cooperative norms. Neuroimaging interpretation from previous studies suggest these behaviors may stem from atypical processing in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, regions critical for valuing social rewards.

In the present study, we investigated semantic fluency as a cognitive strength in English-speaking children with dyslexia aged -. Methods: Ninety-seven children with dyslexia completed tests of letter and semantic verbal fluency, standardized measures of reading and cognitive functions, and task-free resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging . First, we adjusted performance on semantic fluency by letter fluency and created a residual score that was used to separate participants into high or average semantic performance groups. We then employed a psycholinguistic clustering and switching approach to the semantic fluency task and performed dynamic task-free rs-fMRI connectivity analysis to reveal group differences in brain dynamics.Results: High and average semantic fluency groups were well-matched on demographics and letter fluency but differed on their psycholinguistic patterns on the semantic fluency task. The high semantic fluency group, compared to the average semantic fluency group, produced a higher number of words within each cluster, a higher max cluster size, and a higher number of switches. Differential dynamic rs-fMRI connectivity was observed between the high and average groups in a large-scale bilateral frontal-temporal-occipital network.Discussion: These data demonstrate that a subgroup of children with dyslexia perform above average on semantic fluency tasks and their performance is strongly linked to distinct psycholinguistic patterns and differences in a task-free resting-state brain network, which includes regions previously implicated in semantic processing. This work highlights that inter-individual differences should be taken into account in dyslexia and reveals a cognitive area of strength for some children with dyslexia that could be leveraged for reading interventions."

Internal consistency was high, but test-retest reliability was moderate. When controlling for age, phone operating system and sex assigned at birth did not significantly impact performance, but there was a significant difference between those who completed college compared to those with a high school or lower education.Results support the validity of Sequences as a measure of working memory for remote, self-administered use. Internal consistency was strong, with moderate test-retest reliability that is likely a function of the test's unproctored self-administration method. Findings suggest that Sequences is appropriate for use across the adult lifespan in remote, self-administered designs that focus on group results."

The data were collected by using the AGQ-R and the StRIP questionnaire, and analyzed through repeated measures of MANOVAs and correlation coefficient. Pre-service language teachers reported a higher approach goal orientation emphasizing the desire to succeed rather than avoidance goal orientation, i.e., the fear of failure. In terms of classroom practices, the participants report having experienced all types of instruction in the language education program. Although the pre-service teachers’ perception of instruction as passive is preponderant in this study, it does not necessarily point to a higher use of traditional passive lecture and note taking practices. Regardless of the perceived instruction type, the participants’ motivation and engagement remain high, as they report high cognitive and emotional engagement, as well as very high participation and low distraction levels. Regarding correlations, motivation, engagement and active instruction are all highly correlated with each other, as highly motivated and engaged individuals tend to benefit more from active instruction than less motivated students, who chiefly rely on passive instruction for academic success. The results of the study may indicate an emergent need for a careful balance between various teaching strategies and approaches in language education programs in particular, and possibly at tertiary level pedagogy in general."

However, many change processes fail because employees are insufficiently accompanied through the process in a targeted manner. This study of N = employees from a steel industry company undergoing a transformation process examines whether the organizational readiness for change of highly affected employees can be classified into profiles, how these profiles can be predicted by various antecedents, and whether outcome variables such as job satisfaction can be explained by profile membership. Based on five facets of ORC , a total of six ORC profiles were identified: Proactives, Acceptors, Opens, Neutrals, Reluctants and Deniers. Employees’ optimism and the degree of perceived interpersonal and informational fairness can predict profile membership. It was shown that profiles significantly differ in relevant outcome variables satisfaction and intention to leave. These results contribute to the basic understanding of ORC and provide an initial approach for improving ORC profiles which could increase the success rate of change processes in companies."

Since they spend /a significant time of their daily life in school, teachers have a crucial role in providing a safe and bias-free environment for these children. However, teachers might find it challenging to react to bullying based on racism.AIM: This study aims to investigate teachers' experiences of and reactions to racist bullying among pupils in primary schools in The Netherlands. Additionally, this study aims to explore how racism is discussed in class.METHOD: With nine semi-structured in-depth interviews teachers' attitudes and reactions towards racist bullying were examined as well as their perceived competence and skills of handling this. In addition, teachers' availability on tools to discuss racism in class was investigated as well. Data was analyzed using thematic analyses.The results show that teachers emphasize a safe class climate but find it challenging addressing racist incidents, for instance determining its severity, or coping with the external influences on pupils' racist beliefs. Most teachers also expressed to not make a distinction between racist and interpersonal bullying. While teachers expressed that they talked about racism in the classroom, it seemed that they primarily talked about cultural diversity and not racism per se.CONCLUSION: Dealing with racism and racist bullying is an important but complicated task for teachers. Providing teachers with appropriate tools to increase knowledge, awareness and skills will help them to understand the negative impact racism has on children. Further, the results implicate that a pro-active approach can stimulate teachers to critically reflect on their own racial identity, and on school methods, teaching resources and policies concerning racism."

The analysis of global and local measures quantitatively supported altered static functional connectivity patterns and revealed a slower information transmission efficiency in both patient groups. From a dynamic perspective, the spatial distribution of hub nodes exhibited relative stability over time in both normal and patient populations. The increased temporal variability in multiple brain regions within resting-state networks associated with consciousness was detected in MCS patients and VS patients, especially thalamus. As well, the increased spatial variability in multiple brain regions within these resting-state networks was detected in MCS patients and VS patients. In addition, local measure and spatio-temporal variability analysis indicated that the differences in network structure between two groups of patients were mainly in frontoparietal network and auditory network.ConclusionOur findings suggest that altered static and dynamic MST characteristics may shed some light on neural mechanism underlying impaired consciousness."

Intergenerational relationships are fostered with people with dementia through art therapy and life story/narrative at a community-based adult day services center.MethodsIn this sequential mixed methods study, quantitative data were collected via electronic surveys of students in this course compared with students in didactic introductory psychology or psychology and aging courses. Survey measures included empathy, mindfulness, positive and negative affect, future time perspective, and attitudes toward older adults and working with people with dementia. Weekly BATL student journals submitted as part of their course requirements were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.ResultsWithin-subjects analyses of variance revealed increases in empathy and positive affect, broadened time perspective, and improved attitudes toward older adults and people with dementia among students in the BATL course compared with other undergraduate students. Analysis of BATL student journals supported and deepened understanding of these findings, with themes including attitude change, relationship building fostering existential awareness and self-development, art fostering social interactions, and perceived program effectiveness.DiscussionThe findings suggest that BATL strongly supports increased empathetic attitudes and decreased stigma of aging in psychology and pre-healthcare students. Intergenerational expressive arts-based programs like BATL should be implemented in healthcare education to enhance empathy and improve attitudes toward aging and dementia care."

We employed one of McCall’s three intersectionality methodological approaches—intra-categorical complexity—to guide the study. The findings indicated that the AAFSM student participants had experienced intersectional objectifications, including racial, gendered, and sexual objectification. The finding answered our research question regarding what it is like to be AAFSM students attending predominantly White campuses in Midwestern universities. Our findings also showed that the participants intersectionally internalized racism, sexism, and heterosexism as strategies to avoid being ostracized, which in turn allowed society/institution to internalize these -isms as norms. The manifestations of intersectional internalizations reported by participants included racial stereotypes, Whitenization, stereotypical gender roles, gender norms, parental influence, and institutional influence. The findings also indicated that the participants experienced intersectional blindness, which affected their understanding of Asianness, womenness, and LGBTQness. Another meaningful finding was that the racism, sexism, and heterosexism experiences of the AAFSM students were compounded and complex. The theme was best categorized as intersectional post-racism-sexism. We discussed intersectional internalization; de-intersectional-internalization; re-intersectional-internalization; intersectional visibilities, connections, and representations; the implementation of intersectionality; and intersectionalism. The discussions, as a milestone, provided meaningful suggestions for educators, administrators, and universities to effectively create an intersectional inclusive educational environment for AAFSMs."

Given the varied roles of touch, with technology-mediated communication being a big part of our everyday lives, research has been interested in enabling and enhancing distant social interactions with mediated touch over networks. Due to the complexity of the sense of touch and technological limitations, multimodal devices have been developed and investigated. In this article, we explore the use of mediated visual touch in distant social interaction. Adopting an interactionist and collaborative approach to human communication, we focus on the communicative functions of distant touch behaviours which interactants co-elaborate throughout their mediated interactions. For this purpose, we conducted an exploratory study placing five romantically involved couples in interaction, where each discussed shared biographical events via a video call, using mediated touch devices . Their interactions were recorded, and excerpts were presented to participants in interviews using a collective confrontation technique . This technique allows a better understanding of the participants’ points of view on their use of the touch devices in context. Through analysis of the interviews, our results highlight: a variety of visual-touch functions with a redistribution of functions mostly supported by other modalities of communication in face-to-face interactions, such as illustrating aspects of the ongoing conversation; the visual-touch characteristics as well as the verbal, paraverbal and non-verbal indicators of the interactional context considered by the participants to make sense of the stimuli and; the multifactorial and dynamic aspects of the co-elaboration process of the visual-touch functions, reaffirming the role of interactional context, combined with cultural and biographical knowledge, in the meaning making."

The Approach-Avoidance Bias refers to the tendency to approach positive stimuli faster than negative stimuli and to avoid negative stimuli faster than positive ones. Affect and arousal in involved individuals are assumed to play a crucial role in the AAB but many questions in that regard remain open. With this in mind, the present study aimed to examine the impact of positive and negative mood on the AAB.MethodTo achieve this goal, we conducted an experiment where participants watched either positive or negative videos prior to performing an approach-avoidance task.ResultsWe have not been able to confirm our preregistered hypothesis that mood induction moderates the AAB. Instead, our results suggest that an AAB can be robustly shown after both the positive and the negative intervention. Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule results show that the participants' affective state was influenced by the mood intervention only in the form of increased emotional intensity. Participants did not self-report a change in mood valence that corresponds to the valence of the video primes. However, the behavioral data shows that after watching a positive video, participants are faster in approaching positive stimuli than negative stimuli. At the same time, we do not find a similar effect after the negative intervention.DiscussionThese findings suggest that positive and negative affect might play an important role in shaping the AAB that is modulated by stimulus valence. This provides new potential insights into the underlying mechanisms of human motivation and decision-making. Specifically, we argue for potential differences between attention and reaction toward a valenced stimulus."

Nevertheless, they are criticised for their potential negative influence on their followers' physical and mental health due to their potentially biased selfpresentation. Previous research has mainly focused on followers' perceptions of influencers' selfpresentation, leaving a gap regarding the influencers' views. Method: The present survey included female BFFIs from Germany , with self-reported micro-influencers and ten macro-influencers , representing professionals in this domain. influencers saw their main focus in the field of fitness, in fashion, and in beauty. The survey included demographic information, open-ended questions, established and self-developed rating scales, and a social desirability assessment to examine the BFFIs' perceptions of their goals, self-presentation, and role model function. Quantitative data was examined via inter-correlation matrix and ANOVA, and qualitative data was analysed via content analysis based on the established approach by Mayring .Results: Influencers pursue mostly self-realisation and commercial goals . While they generally perceive their self-presentation as authentic and positive , they still see room for improvement in content creation and self-presentation . Fear of negative feedback, absence of positivity and motivation, wrong cooperation partners and insecurity , among others, may lead to a less authentic self-presentation and use of picture editing. The tendency towards socially desirable responses is negatively connected to the reported frequency of image editing tools used and attempts to appear authentic. Influencers reported several examples of responsible and irresponsible behaviours and strategies to avoid negative effects on their followers.The type of influencer showed a significant effect on the importance attributed to one's own role as an influencer.Discussion: The complex findings suggest potential conflicts between the influencers' goals and the expectations of followers and cooperation partners.

Body exposure therapy is a widely used approach to treat this; however, it is unclear which part of body exposure therapy is relevant for regaining a realistic perspective on the own body. This study aimed to examine the role of the attentional bias , which AN patients exhibit to the most disliked parts of their body. Additionally, emotional responses to the body exposure sessions were examined.MethodsParticipants were adolescent girls with a diagnosis of AN, who were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a treatment-as-usual group. Both groups completed a pre and a post session, which included the completion of questionnaires to measure AN-psychopathology. The INT group received four sessions of a computer-based body exposure between the pre and the post session. The viewing pattern was recorded before and after each intervention session via an eyetracking device, as were emotional response scores on a visual analog scale . The TAU group did not receive the intervention, but viewing patterns were recorded during the pre and the post session. All participants were asked to list their three least favorite body parts to be able to subsequently assess the AB.ResultsFifty-eight adolescent girls with AN participated in the study. There were no differences in psychopathology pre to post session, as measured by administered questionnaires. The existence of an AB could be replicated, but there was no significant reduction in the AB pre to post session in the INT group, nor was there an interaction between group and time. Also, no changes in the AB were found within and between sessions in the INT group. Anxiety scores reduced significantly across sessions while disgust scores were significantly higher post session than they were pre session.ConclusionsWhile the existence of an AB was demonstrated, the carried-out body exposures were neither sufficient to reduce the AB nor the psychopathology; nevertheless, a significant decrease in anxiety levels showed the usefulness of the exposure sessions.

Avoidance is one of the strategies smokers with anxiety adopt to manage negative affect, which can be contradictory to a strategy of cigarette warnings that is used to induce negative affect to change smoking behaviors. Therefore, this study examined whether smokers' anxiety levels decrease their attentional biases toward cigarette warnings, especially in response to emotional distress. High-anxiety and low-anxiety smokers were randomly assigned to either a stress condition that utilized the PASAT-C task or a controlled condition. With the eye-tracking task that involved viewing visual stimuli of cigarette packs composed of warnings and brandings, time to first fixation and fixation duration to warnings compared to brandings were measured both pre and post conditions. The results revealed that high-anxiety smokers detected warnings faster after stress conditions while low-anxiety smokers showed the consistent time to first fixation on warnings. In terms of fixation durations, high-anxiety smokers showed hypervigilance toward warnings that are considered to be a threat, but low-anxiety smokers showed avoidance under stress conditions, particularly toward social-focused warnings. These results indicate that high-anxiety smokers are more vulnerable to emotional distress and have an attentional bias toward fear appeals. Despite hypervigilance, they had greater psychological reactance toward warnings that the conflict between avoidance and hypervigilance might have contributed to, so the effectiveness of fear appeals may be limited regardless of the increased fixation duration."

We examined the effect of such interference on fluency indices including correct responses, clustering, switching, and time course.Results All secondary tasks decreased fluency , including a simple concurrent task that solely engages the attentional activation system and a complex concurrent task that affects the ability to alternate . Linguistic secondary tasks led to a greater decrease in fluency than speed interference , with a more pronounced decrease in semantic fluency induced by semantic interference , and the highest decrease in all types of fluency induced by phonological interference . In terms of derived indices, speed interference decreased switching without affecting clustering and phonological interference mainly affected the first time interval, whereas speed and flexibility interference primarily affected the last time interval .DiscussionThese results, based on an interference design, indicate that letter and semantic fluency involve output lexico-phonological and semantic processes with which the strategic search process interacts, as well as an attentional component necessary to accelerate overall processing. These results also highlight interactions with other executive processes, such as those involved in stimulus dimension alternation, which require further analysis. They support our model and provide information concerning derived indices. The commonly claimed associations of executive function with switching and of semantic ability with clustering are only partially supported by our results.

The spectral profile framework suggests that the spectral components of clustered patterns induces trypophobia. In contrast, the cognitive framework speculates that cognitive appraisal of dangerous objects causes trypophobia. A background effect seems to support the cognitive framework. However, there is no study providing objective evidence for that effect and verifying these frameworks at the same time. This study aims to address that limitation by psychometric and eye-tracking experiments.MethodsWe recruited participants from colleges. Initially, participants finished a personality questionnaire. The cohort then completed an eye-tracking experiment which showed the trypophobic pattern of lotus seed on three categories of background images . Finally, participants rated the image’s disgust and arousal levels using a self-assessment rating scale. Meanwhile, we compared all images’ luminosity and power spectra.ResultsTrypophobic images with the human body or animal backgrounds induced a higher level of disgust and arousal than those with the object backgrounds. Participants gazed faster and dwelled longer at the trypophobic patterns on human body images than on object or animal images. Furthermore, trypophobic images with human body or animal backgrounds induced more substantial pupil dilation than those upon object backgrounds. No significant difference was detected between the power of trypophobic images with human body backgrounds and objects backgrounds. As the trypophobic images with human body backgrounds induced significant emotional or visual responses compared to those with inanimate object backgrounds. Such inconsistent results imply that the differential emotional or visual responses to trypophobic images are probably not induced by the difference in power spectra. Finally, the disgust/arousal level toward trypophobic images did not correlate with personality traits.ConclusionThese results supported the background effect of trypophobia, namely, trypophobic images with animal or human body backgrounds induce more severe disgust and cause more arousal than those with object backgrounds. Our results support the cognitive, but not spectral profile, framework of trypophobia."

These abilities are thought to be generally maintained in older adults, accompanied by the emergence of attentional biases to positive information. Such age-related positivity biases, however, are not always reported and may be moderated by individual differences in affective vulnerabilities and competencies, such as those related to dispositional negative affect and emotion regulation styles. To examine these relationships, we analyzed eye-tracking data from participants , without and with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder during a free-viewing task comprising neutral-neutral, negative-neutral, and positive-neutral image pairs. Emotional bias scores were calculated based on the ratio of time spent dwelling on the emotional image vs. the neutral image in each emotional-neutral pair. Results indicate that healthy participants exhibited a stronger positivity bias than a negativity bias, whereas individuals with higher depressive symptom scores showed no difference. Next, we examined how age and emotion regulation strategy use impacted these effects. Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder did not exhibit a significant relationship between age and positivity bias. However, for healthy participants who self-reported a preference for using reappraisal in daily life, increased age was associated with an increased positivity bias.

To develop the systematic teaching model, a design-based research methodology was utilized, incorporating iterative refinement based on empirical findings and expert feedback. Grounded in Goleman's Emotional Intelligence Theory, the study revealed a progressive increase in emotional vocabulary, with more complex emotions introduced at advanced levels. Positive emotions were more frequent at beginner levels, while negative and neutral emotions increased at higher stages, supporting self-regulation and empathy development. The systematic teaching model proposed in the study addresses key EI components such as self-awareness, social skills, and emotional regulation by scaffolding emotional vocabulary instruction across proficiency levels. This model provides a structured framework to equip educators with the emotional and linguistic tools necessary for effective classroom management and enhanced student outcomes.

Two possible mechanisms can cause pareidolia: a bottom-up mechanism that automatically detects inverted triangle or top-heavy patterns, and a top-down mechanism that actively seeks out faces.

In chimpanzees, it has been suggested that the bottom-up mechanism is involved in their pareidolic perception, but the extent of the contribution of the top-down mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated the role of top-down control in face detection in chimpanzees. After being trained on an oddity task in which they had to select a noise pattern where a face or a letter was superimposed among three patterns, they were tested with noise patterns that did not contain any target stimuli.

These ERPs, taken together, suggest that the task was more attentionally demanding for the NOP group. Additionally, some markers identified in previous ERP studies on the DOP were absent, indicating that the outcome expectancies may not have been fully generated. Finally, there were also interactions between the valence of the facial stimuli, participant group, and some of the potentials, such as N or N during encoding. These findings suggest that participants in the DOP group may have allocated more attentional resources to processing expressions of positive-valence emotions during earlier stages, possibly due to reward expectancy effects."

A sample of healthy participants aged to years took part in the study.ResultsThe SCR scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency and construct validity, supporting the theoretical model of perceived cognitive reserve. Convergent validity was confirmed through a positive correlation between SCR scores and resilience as well as with other cognitive reserve measures, indicating consistency in evaluating cognitive reserve across various instruments. Furthermore, discriminant validity was demonstrated by a significant negative correlation between SCR scores and subjective cognitive decline, suggesting that individuals with higher cognitive reserve experience lower levels of perceived cognitive decline. No significant relationship was found between SCR scores and chronological age, further supporting the construct validity of the scale by showing that cognitive reserve is influenced by dynamic factors beyond age.ConslusionThe findings highlight the potential of the SCR scale as a reliable and valid tool for assessing cognitive reserve and its protective role in cognitive health and well-being over time."

We hypothesize that threatened masculinity contributes to such gender differences in Sweden. Threatened masculinity refers to the perception that a man’s masculinity is being challenged, undermined, or devalued, often due to societal changes that advance women’s rights. Given that environmental care and concern are typically associated with femininity, men who perceive that masculinity is threatened may be more likely to deny climate change to restore a sense of masculinity. Across three cross-sectional online surveys with representative samples of Swedish adults , men were more likely to deny climate change than women. Threatened masculinity—measured by belief in a shift in sexism and belongingness with men’s rights activists—predicted climate change denial. In line with our hypothesis, belief in a sexism shift and, to a lesser extent, belongingness with men’s rights activists mediated from gender to climate change denial. Hence threatened masculinity contributes to a higher tendency among men compared to women to deny climate change in these samples. This research adds to the understanding of gender gaps in environmental attitudes found in many Western countries and highlights climate change denial as a potential correlate of the growing gender-related polarization observed in these contexts."

The electronic questionnaire which contains the rhinological symptom scale, the -item Sinonasal Outcome Test Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire- , the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- , the Insomnia Severity Index , and the Patient Health Questionnaire- was filled out by patients at admission. The associations between the scores of symptom/SNOT- and psychometric tests were assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient and simple linear regression. The receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the SNOT- score in predicting psychiatric disorders.ResultsThirteen patients with benign sinonasal tumors and patients with malignant sinonasal tumors were recruited. The benign and malignant groups did not differ significantly regarding symptomatology and mental wellbeing. Of the total patients, were at risk of depression , were at risk of anxiety , were at risk of insomnia , and were at risk of SSD . The overall symptom, facial pain/pressure, postnasal drip, and SNOT- scores were positively associated with scores of psychometric tests. Patients with a high SNOT- score are likely to be affected by comorbid psychiatric disorders. When interpreting the results of this study, it should be noted that screening tools, not diagnostic tools, were used to identify psychiatric risk.ConclusionDepression, anxiety, insomnia, and SSD are prevalent in patients with sinonasal tumors. Otolaryngologists should have a low threshold to ask the patient about psychiatric symptoms, especially for patients with an SNOT- score &gt; ."

This study applied a Psycho-Cardiology model to CHD management, aiming to assess psychological stress among patients with mild CHD and identify potential influencing factors to provide substantiating evidence.MethodsThis longitudinal study was based on a -year follow-up program of a community population in Shanghai, China. A total of , elderly people were included, with the average age being . years, and the proportion of female participants being .%. To evaluate and compare the effect of the disease, individuals were categorized into four groups based on their medical records from the past months, these being a CHD with other chronic diseases group, a CHD only group, non-CHD patients with one chronic disease group, and non-patient group. Demographic characteristics, sleep quality and health status of each participants were collected using the Unified Needs Assessment Form for Elderly Care Questionnaire. A multivariate logistic regression was used for statistic analysis.ResultsDemographic characteristics differed significantly between the three chronic disease groups and the non-patient group. Participants in the CHD group reported poorer sleep quality, worse health status, and a more rapid health decline when compared to those with other chronic diseases. Factors such as age, gender, education level, disease duration, and family support were identified as potential influences on the self-reported subjective sleep quality in patients with mild CHD. While age, education level, living status and family support were potential factors influencing the self-assessed health status in participants without CHD .ConclusionPatients with mild CHD may experience lower subjective sleep quality, health status scores, and a faster health-sleep decline, indicating elevated psychological stress. Higher education levels offer a protective effect against this stress, highlighting the importance of psycho-emotional interventions and educational strategies. Additionally, it is important to prioritize early intervention for newly diagnosed cases to aid in illness acceptance.

Previous research has primarily focused on upper-grade elementary students, with relatively less attention given to younger age groups, resulting in insufficient representativeness of the elementary student samples. Additionally, research exploring how parental addictive behaviors are associated with the mechanisms of internet addiction among elementary students has been limited, which affects the development of scientifically based and effective intervention measures for addressing internet addiction in this population. This study, grounded in Family Systems Theory, explores the associative mechanisms between parental smartphone dependence and elementary students’ internet addiction, specifically examining the mediating role of parent–child conflict and the moderating role of parental roles. Using a convenience sampling method, questionnaires were administered to parents from two elementary schools, resulting in valid responses. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that parental smartphone dependence is associated with elementary students’ internet addiction and that this association is further influenced by the mediating role of parent–child conflict. Additionally, parental roles moderate the relationships between parental smartphone dependence and parent–child conflict, as well as between parent–child conflict and elementary students’ internet addiction. Compared to mothers, fathers’ smartphone dependence is more significantly correlated with parent–child conflict, and conflicts initiated by fathers are more strongly associated with elementary students’ internet addiction. This may be related to China’s traditional “male breadwinner, female homemaker” family culture. Mothers typically assume more parenting responsibilities and establish closer emotional bonds with their children, serving as a protective factor against internet addiction. Therefore, it is recommended that parents reduce smartphone dependence to avoid parent–child conflicts, and that fathers increase their involvement in parenting activities to build stronger emotional connections with their children, thereby fostering healthier internet use behaviors among elementary students. The findings provide valuable insights for developing effective family-based interventions to address internet addiction in children."

This process underpins the contextual cueing effect, where repeated exposure allows individuals to learn associations between contextual cues and targets, thereby enhancing visual search efficiency. However, the cue validity of context —how consistently cues predict target locations—is not always guaranteed in real life. This study focused on cue validity as a critical factor in understanding the contextual cueing effect. Within the study of contextual cueing, cue validity specifically refers to the probability that contextual cues accurately indicate the location of a target.MethodsIn Experiment , we manipulated three levels of cue validity using a classic contextual cueing paradigm. Experiment examined the potential impact of an imbalanced predictable vs unpredictable trial ratio. In Experiment , we explored whether the absence of the contextual cueing effect was due to unsuccessful learning or unsuccessful later expression.ResultsResults from Experiment revealed that higher cue validity significantly elicited the contextual cueing effect, resulting in faster responses for repeated displays, whereas lower cue validity did not result in this effect because the repeated displays could not be effectively learned. Experiment showed that the contextual cueing effect remained robust despite an imbalanced ratio of predictable to unpredictable displays. Experiment further showed that low cue validity affects the early learning phase of context-target associations rather than the later expression in visual search.ConclusionOur study highlights the significant role of cue validity in implicit learning from visual cues. High cue validity enhances learning by providing highly stable context-target associations, while low cue validity does not actively facilitate attention allocation, thereby not promoting the learning process. These findings underscore the importance of cue validity in processing visual information."

In this paper, we introduce a novel tool, which we label SEMbeddings. This tool integrates mpnet-personality with latent measurement models to assess model fit or misfit prior to data collection. To support our statement, we apply SEMbeddings to the items of the VIA-IS-P, which measures different character strengths, using responses from , participants. Our analysis shows a significant, though not perfect, correlation between the cosine similarities of embeddings and empirical correlations among items. We then demonstrate how to fit confirmatory factor analyses on the cosine similarity matrices produced by mpnet-personality and interpret the outcomes using modification indices. We found that relying on traditional fit indices when using SEMbeddings can be misleading as they often lead to more conservative conclusions compared to empirical results. Nevertheless, they provide valuable suggestions about possible misfit, and we argue that the modification indices obtained from these models could serve as a useful screening tool to make informed decisions about items prior to data collection.

However, there is very limited research on digital religious behavior in mainland China. This study fills this gap by extending the Theory of Planned Behavior to predict additional influencing factors of digital religious intentions and behavior. The results show that attitudes toward digital religion, perceived behavioral control, social identity, and empathetic willingness are predictors of intentions, while social norms are not. Intentions significantly predict users' behavior on social media platforms such as Weibo and Douyin. Moreover, empathetic willingness and social identity fully mediate the effects of subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitudes on intentions. Consequently, these behaviors generate impact, indicating the presence of multiple mediation effects. These findings may help reveal the evolution of religious attitudes and behaviors among Generation Z in the rapidly developing and complex social media context, providing practical support for the application of the extended TPB model in China."

This study investigates the serial mediating effects of positive and negative affect, fear of missing out, and offline and online self-presentation in the relationship between social media use and social media addiction.MethodThe study was conducted in Hong Kong with participants of an online survey. This study administered the Social Media Use Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Fear of Missing Out Scale, Presentation of Online Self Scale, and Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale.ResultsThe results indicate that social media use plays a significant role in predicting both positive and negative affect. The findings further reveal that positive and negative affect, fear of missing out, and offline and online self-presentation act as serial mediators in the relationship between social media use and social media addiction. In other words, these variables work together in a sequential manner to mediate the impact of social media use on addiction. Additionally, the study indicates that social media use and social media addiction are fully mediated by both positive and negative affect, fear of missing out, and offline and online self-presentation.DiscussionSocial media use can evoke both positive and negative affect. The longer individuals are immersed in social media, the more their positive affect intensifies, exacerbating FoMO and fostering inconsistent offline and online self-presentation. Conversely, extended social media engagement can heighten negative affect, leading to anxiety about others having more rewarding experiences and concurrently inducing apprehension characterized by FoMO. To prevent addiction, the development of educational tools such as SimCity video games, scenario-based learning activities, and virtual reality experiences focused on social media use and social media addiction can offer a valuable opportunity for pre-exposure to the related risks and challenges."

Assessment tools included the Physical Activity Rating Scale, Social Interaction Questionnaire, Emotional Experience Questionnaire, and Subjective Wellbeing Scale. Data were analyzed using Stata and the PROCESS plug-in of SPSS for comprehensive multivariate statistical analysis.ResultsWatching sports events significantly and positively affects subjective wellbeing, social interaction, and emotional experience . Three mediating pathways were identified: watching sports events → social interaction → subjective wellbeing , watching sports events → emotional experience → subjective wellbeing , and watching sports events → social interaction → emotional experience → subjective wellbeing .ConclusionThe direct impact of watching sports events on subjective wellbeing was positive. Indirect effects were facilitated by the mediating roles of social interaction and emotional experience, with the effect of social interaction being more substantial than that of emotional experience.ImplicationsThese findings suggest that watching sports events can serve as a catalyst for enhancing wellbeing, primarily through fostering social connections and enriching emotional experiences.

In a world of ever-growing urban populations, it is important to understand how to make cities healthier and more pleasant places to live. In the present study, we investigated the impact of art as an urban intervention and compared it to the well-known effects of greenery in an identically framed intervention. Specifically, we looked at how people engage with a Graetzloase and its embedding urban environment in terms of visual and spatial attraction as well as wellbeing. The Graetzloase displayed either abstract art or greenery and was placed on two distinct streets that, among other elements, also contained art and greenery. Our field study captured the ongoing experiences during people’s exploration of the urban environment by employing mobile eye-trackers and physiological devices. While our findings demonstrated a certain level of visual and spatial attraction towards the Graetzloases, it was not as pronounced as initially anticipated. Nevertheless, our analyses still inform on What decorating element should be placed in a Graetzloase, as well as Where to implement the Graetzloase. Our results suggest that artistic elements are more visually attractive than the greenery, and that both visual and spatial attraction towards the Graetzloases are greatly impacted by the street context. We found that the Art Graetzloase when displayed in a wide street containing greenery elements, is visually more present in the participant’s visual field than all the other experimental combinations. The more precise analyses of the participant viewing behavior confirm this trend. Regarding wellbeing, we found no evidence for the impact of street context or the types of decorations in the Graetzloases.

In open-ended learners, adult songs are plastic, that is, birds retain the ability to change their songs. In some seasonal open-ended learners, including canaries, songs become stable at the onset of each breeding season. However, whether context-dependent plasticity of songs occurs during the breeding season remains elusive. We used custom-made telemetric backpack sound recording technology in five groups of canaries to monitor song-based communication from three males in competition for females during the breeding season. This allowed us to record each male's songs during social interactions. We show that canaries proactively overlap their songs in time during aggressive vocal exchanges that we call duels. Birds that engage in duels take leader or follower roles on a song-to-song basis. When a male canary leads a duel, his songs last longer relative to his solo songs, increasing the chance to outlast the follower's song. Moreover, the durations of leader and follower songs in duels are correlated, suggesting an interactive online adjustment of their songs. Remarkably, in each group, only two out of the three males extensively engage in duels whereas the third canary rarely participates. Overall, our findings reveal context-dependent behavioral flexibility of male-directed canary song signaling, characterized by a moment-to-moment plasticity different from the slow, well-studied seasonal plasticity. By their context-dependent modulation of the relative timing and duration of vocal exchanges, canary duels offer a window into the social cognitive abilities of songbirds."

Substance use is prevalent among medical students and is often considered a maladaptive coping strategy for stress, as well as a risk factor for mental health issues. Sexual problems and substance use share trauma exposure and post-traumatic symptoms as risk factors for their development. This study aimed to explore the interaction effects between problematic sexual behaviors, substance use, and trauma among German MS. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire. MS at a German university were recruited via email. CSB , SFP , harmful alcohol and drug use , childhood trauma exposure , and current post-traumatic symptoms were assessed. Multivariate linear and ordinal regressions, as well as path analyses, were conducted to investigate associations between the study variables. CSB was identified in % of all MS. The most commonly reported SFPs were decreased sexual desire and difficulties achieving orgasms among women and premature ejaculation among men. Higher CSBD scores were predicted by male sex, elevated AUDIT scores, and increased frequencies of hyperarousal . Path analyses revealed associations between the severity of emotional/sexual abuse, the intensity of post-traumatic symptoms, and both CSBD and AUDIT scores. Among female MS, less severe emotional abuse and more severe physical abuse in childhood predicted higher frequencies of orgasmic difficulties. The frequency of SFPs was correlated with the use of benzodiazepines among female MS, with cannabis and MDMA/ecstasy among male MS, and with cocaine/crack, speed, and AUDIT among both sexes. No interaction effects were found between SFPs, substance use, or trauma-related factors in the path analyses. To some extent, there appears to be a relationship between substance use, childhood trauma exposure, and currently persisting post-traumatic symptoms with problematic sexual behaviors among MS. However, further research is required to explore these relationships in greater depth and to identify the underlying pathways. Mental health support measures should incorporate the factors of sexuality, substance use, and trauma while also exploring their relationships with workload, career-related anxieties, and other curriculum-related factors."

TNBA face higher risks of varied behavioral health concerns compared to their cisgender peers, a disparity often attributed to the presence of minority stress due to discrimination. To date, no comprehensive measures of gender-related minority stress exist for use with TNBA.MethodThe present study recruited a U.S. national sample of TNBA. An initial item pool was developed from life history calendars, a modified Delphi process, and cognitive interviews with TNBA. Analytic methods including principal components analysis, item response theory, measurement invariance testing, and reliability analyses were conducted to establish the final scale. Concurrent validity was established across behavioral outcomes , and convergent and divergent validity compared the Transgender Adolescent Stress Survey–Minority Stress to existing measures of gender-related minority stress.ResultsThe TASS-MS and its subscales were significantly associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, suicidal behaviors, non-suicidal self-injury, marijuana, and prescription drug use. The TASS-MS was moderately and weakly correlated with convergent and divergent measures, respectively, indicating specificity to minority stress.ConclusionThe TASS-MS is a reliable and valid measure for future research with TNBA.

These abilities are important foundations in order to adapt to school, interact with peers and adults, as well as to navigate the wider socio-cultural context in which one develops. Further, young children are also acquiring and deepening their language and preliteracy skills which are important for later academic learning. Central to cognitive abilities are the processes that enable deliberate and goal-oriented actions, which fall under the conceptual umbrella of executive functions . In this study, we applied a conceptually broad perspective to examine cognitive abilities, preliteracy and SEC in preschool aged children. Children were participants in an intervention trial of the preschool edition of Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies conducted in preschools located in three municipalities within a large city in Sweden. Pre-test data were used to examine cognitive abilities and SEC in this sample of Swedish to -year-old children . We first performed an exploratory factor analysis including the wide range of examined abilities, and found that measures of abilities typically viewed as SEC, did not group with measures of preliteracy skills and abilities typically considered as EFs. Second, we performed confirmatory factor analyses on remaining relevant indicators of cognitive abilities, which indicated a two-factor model best fit the data, with one factor involving inhibitory control and one factor involving more complex and high-demanding skills . Results indicated that more complex EFs and preliteracy skills were closely linked, and can be differentiated from inhibitory control, already in the preschool years. Findings also point to the importance of including a broad range of cognitive abilities in order to gain a nuanced description of possible interrelations between cognitive and social emotional development. Furthermore, this study contributes to the theoretical discussion on EF structure during childhood, and provides a sound empirical rationale for the further development of early interventions that consider young children’s executive functions and preliteracy skills."

The lack of clarity impedes attempts to understand relationships between ToM and other cognitive abilities. This study investigated the nature of the ToM construct and its relation to cognitive variables by administering a battery of ToM measurements along with measurements of executive function and general vocabulary to adult participants. Associations between ToM tasks were statistically significant after controlling for covariates, but, for the most part, very weak in magnitude. The strongest relationship was between the Strange Stories and Higher-Order False Belief measurements. Previous theoretical analysis proposes those instruments are conceptually linked by a perspective taking requirement that entails representing another’s mental state. Results from a factor analysis suggested an underlying ToM structure—a protagonist perspective factor. The Strange Stories, Higher-Order False Belief, and Frith-Happé Animation tasks loaded onto the factor. Its defining feature is the ascription of mental states to predict and explain protagonists’ actions that take place within a narrative structure. It is related more strongly to vocabulary than executive function and it provides grounds for future research on the role of narrative processing in ToM reasoning."

The variation in the increase in reaction times and error rates is termed as the language switch cost. Generally, bilingual language-switching costs demonstrate asymmetry, with a greater cost associated with transitioning from the weaker L to the dominant L than in the reverse scenario. Recent studies have demonstrated that language switching can be modulated under certain conditions. However, the effect of emotion on language-switching performance is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of emotions on bilingual language switching and how this impact manifests across different time windows.MethodsThis study explored the influence of emotion on language switching between Chinese and English using a dual task involving emotion priming and word-picture matching, with concurrent measurement of event-related potentials.ResultsThe behavioral results indicated that a happy mood improved the accuracy and efficiency of L switching, while a fearful mood enhanced the efficiency of L switching. Electrophysiological data revealed significant interactions among emotion, language, and task in the P, N, and N stages. Specifically, a happy mood was associated with an increased P amplitude during L switching, larger N amplitudes during L repetition, L switching, and L repetition, as well as greater N amplitudes during L repetition, L switching, and L repetition, along with a larger N during L repetition. Conversely, a fearful mood exhibited a significantly larger N during L switching and a larger N during L switching.DiscussionThe study findings suggest that positive emotions were beneficial for L switching in the early stages of visual attention allocation, conflict processing, and lexical-semantic processing. In contrast, negative emotions exhibited a more significant advantage for L switching in lexical-semantic processing and deeper levels of semantic processing. This study provides the first electrophysiological evidence for the impact of emotion priming on language-switching performance."

Less attention has been paid to how multilevel metacognition, including individual metacognition, interpersonal metacognition, and group metacognition, functions. There is also less research on whether group metacognition influences collaborative learning through other levels of metacognition. To investigate the emergence of multilevel metacognition among learners with varying achievement and its effects on group performance and regulation patterns, this study employed both traditional and process analyses to examine how the distribution and interactions of multilevel metacognition influence group performance and group regulation. The study revealed that in collaborative learning, group metacognition exerts the most significant influence on group performance compared to other metacognitive levels, such as individual metacognition and interpersonal metacognition. Specifically, the study identified three collaborative achievement categories by judging the degree of collaborative benefit based on individual preparation and group performance: H_T category, EF category and L_T category. The H_T and EF categories performed better and developed more group metacognition, while the L_T category exhibited poorer performance and less group metacognition.

However, when patients remain silent, it can serve various functions, such as reflecting more deeply or hesitating to elaborate on a topic. This article uses conversation analysis to examine a specific context in which silence occurs: After a patient has concluded his/her narrative, both the therapist and the patient resist the turn allocation by the respective other, resulting in mutual silence. The results indicate that both therapists and patients collaboratively generate this silence. Therapists typically end the silence with an intervention, addressing an aspect of the topic and treating the pause as intra-topic silence. The study is based on approximately h of video recordings of German-speaking outpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions. This research highlights the importance of therapists recognizing the different forms of silence that may emerge during psychotherapy."

However, the underlying mechanisms linking these variables remain unclear. Grounded in ecological systems theory, this study explores the impact mechanisms of social support , individual resource , and environmental factor on adolescents’ internalizing problem behaviors.MethodsA questionnaire survey of adolescents in vocational school aged – assessed maternal emotional warmth, meaning in life, friendship conflict, and internalizing problem behaviors.ResultsThe results indicate that the meaning in life partially mediates the relationship between maternal emotional warmth and adolescents’ internalizing problem behaviors, with friendship conflict moderating the latter half of this mediation pathway.DiscussionThe findings suggest that adolescents, during their social adaptation process, activate different protective factors depending on the environmental relational context. Specifically, high friendship conflict limits the direct protective role of maternal emotional warmth, whereas a meaning in life becomes a significant protective factor, exerting its effect through mediation. Conversely, when friendship conflict is low, maternal emotional warmth directly serves as a protective factor."

Under the condition of social mentality, sports participation has a positive effect on the social identity of college students in general and a nonsignificant effect only on certain dimensions. Under the social identity condition, the significance of sports participation for college students’ social identity decreases from lower to higher levels of education.ConclusionSports participation significantly enhances the social identity of Chinese university students, and the specific mechanism of the enhancement varies across the social mentality and social identity conditions. In this context, strengthening the role of sports participation in promoting the social identity of college students in the new era is necessary. Deepening the ideological content of physical education courses should be taken as the starting point to enhance the effectiveness of sports participation on the social identity of college students under the condition of social mentality. The effectiveness of sports participation on the social identity of college students with different social identities should be differentiated and enhanced."

To this end, the study sought to answer how female football observers are constructed in a marginalized position within the male-dominated football culture through sources of social pressure, and how they accommodate the acceptance of legitimizing the system despite encountering glass ceiling barriers in the context of Turkey.MethodData for the research were collected through in-depth individual interviews using qualitative research methods. The collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis. After a comprehensive analysis of the interview transcripts, four themes emerged:FindingsGender-based positive and negative experiences; Glass Ceiling: Organizational Factors; Legitimization of Hierarchy-Reducing Myths; and Hope for Future Intragroup Progress within the Current System.RecommendationsOur analysis reveals that female football observers, identified as match officials, indicate changes in authoritarian attitudes within recent institutional policies during their stadium experiences, characterized towards a more rational, female observer, and referee-focused stance. Additionally, entrenched stereotypes and legitimizing myths reducing hierarchy appear to generally establish legitimacy for female match officiating within the legitimization process.

This framework opens up a new perspective on multimodal affective stance-taking in the context of specific media ecologies. It exemplifies this new approach with case studies of the official audiovisual documentation of political debates in the German Bundestag and the Polish Sejm. This new approach addresses the intertwining of audiovisual multimodality with verbo-gestural expressivity . Adopting a phenomenological position, we are interested in how the orchestration of the debates as audiovisual events moves the spectators. The concepts ‘Expressive Movement’ and ‘Dynamic Forms of Vitality’ serve as theoretical and methodological references to capture the affective dynamics of audiovisual debates and how these audiovisual images modulate the perceptions and experiences of the spectators. To illustrate and substantiate this approach for linguistic and media analyses of affective stance-taking, the paper outlines basic assumptions and methods. It offers two exemplary case studies from German and Polish parliamentary debates. It is concluded that bringing together media-aesthetic with linguistic analyses of multimodal communication and interaction provides not only a valid starting point for future research of multimodal stance-taking in different media ecologies but also allows researchers to address how and why spectators of audiovisual media performances are moved affectively."

A total of preschoolers participated. Emotion understanding was assessed using The Test of Emotion Comprehension at the baseline and then again at a -year follow-up. In addition to the primary variables, executive functions and non-verbal intelligence were controlled for in the analysis. We used the Dimensional Change Card Sort task to assess cognitive flexibility, the Sentence Repetition and Memory for Designs subtests of NEPSY-II to measure verbal and visual working memory, respectively, and Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices to assess non-verbal intelligence. Sibling data were obtained from the parent surveys, while psychological assessments were administered to children by psychologists. While sibling family structure influences emotion understanding, it does not significantly affect its development over a year. A more advanced reflective emotional understanding is associated with higher cognitive flexibility and having a younger sibling, compared to other sibling positions. The results of this study offer additional knowledge for parents, educators, family therapists, and child psychologists seeking a deeper understanding of emotional development in children. These professionals can design interventions and programs that leverage sibling and peer relationships to foster emotional development, encourage collaboration through age-diverse activities, and promote caregiving roles to enhance family and group dynamics."

One of the most valid ways in the psycholinguistics domain to explore these doubts is to examine the masked translation priming effect and the priming asymmetry through cross-language priming experiments. In this study, a masked priming lexical decision task was conducted with unbalanced English-Chinese bilinguals to investigate whether the masked translation priming effect exists in both translation directions, and to further reveal how the number of translations, which can be categorized into one-translation pair and more-than-one-translation pair conditions, affects the priming effects and modulates translation priming asymmetry. It was demonstrated that both translation direction and the number of translations influence the priming effect. Specifically, the priming effect was observable from L to L but not from L to L, and the priming for one-translation pairs was significantly greater when compared to that for more-than-one-translation pairs. Moreover, the impacts of translation direction on the priming effect differed between the one-translation pair and more-than-one-translation pair conditions: under the former condition, substantial priming occurred in both directions, whereas for the latter condition, it was observed only in the L–L direction.

The findings indicate that both challenge and hindrance stressors significantly increase knowledge hiding, with hindrance stressors exerting a more pronounced effect. Furthermore, the study reveals the mediating roles of job crafting and work withdrawal, highlighting the distinct mechanisms involved with these stressors. Specifically, challenge stressors increase the likelihood of knowledge hiding through work withdrawal while simultaneously decreasing it through job crafting; notably, the former pathway has a greater effect. In contrast, hindrance stressors consistently exert detrimental effects, amplifying the probability of knowledge hiding through both mediators, which explains their stronger impact compared to challenge stressors. Additionally, empowering leadership plays a crucial moderating role in this relationship. The adverse influence of hindrance stressors on knowledge hiding, as mediated by job crafting, intensifies under high levels of empowering leadership. These findings not only validate the newly constructed parallel mediation model within an educational context but also provide practical strategies for kindergarten administrators regarding knowledge management. Such strategies include effectively distinguishing and managing different types of job stressors, enhancing skills to empower employees, and organizing regular knowledge-sharing activities."

From this sample, individuals with exercise anxiety were identified through an endurance exercise test and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire subsequently administered as well as The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion . Subsequently, statistical analyses including correlation, regression, and mediation were performed using SPSS as the analytical tool. Additionally, the bias-corrected nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method was used to test for the mediating effects and estimate the confidence intervals with , iterations, and the confidence interval was set at %. Finally, in AMOS, a mediating construct was established by incorporating exercise anxiety as the dependent variable, endurance exercise behavior as the independent variable, and negative physical sensations and experiential avoidance as the mediating variables . A path analytic procedure was employed to test the hypotheses while percentile bootstrap analysis was conducted to examine the indirect effects.ResultsThe results show that endurance exercise negatively predicts negative physical sensations , negative physical sensation positively predicts experiential avoidance and exercise anxiety , and experiential avoidance positively predicts exercise anxiety .ConclusionThere were significant correlations among endurance exercise, negative physical sensation, experiential avoidance and exercise anxiety. Endurance exercise affects exercise anxiety through two ways: endurance exercise → negative physical sensation → exercise anxiety; endurance exercise → negative physical sensation → experiential avoidance → exercise anxiety. Negative physical sensations and experiential avoidance play mediating and chain-mediating roles between endurance exercise and exercise anxiety."

However, in certain contexts, repeating negations undergo adaptation, which over time mitigates the effort. Here, we ask whether negations hamper visual processing and whether consecutive repetitions mitigate its influence. We assessed the overall attentional capacity, that is, the available processing resources, and its distribution, the relative weight, quantitatively using the formal Theory of Visual Attention . We employed a very simple form for negations, binary negations on top of an accuracy-based, TVA-based temporal-order judgment paradigm. Negated instructions, expressing the only alternative to the core supposition, were cognitively demanding, resulting in a loss of attentional capacity in three experiments. The overall attentional capacity recovered gradually but stagnated at a lower level than with assertions, even after many repetitions. Additionally, negations distributed the attention equally between the target and reference stimulus. Repetitions slightly increased the reference stimulus' share of attention. Assertions, on the other hand, shifted the attentional weight toward the target stimulus. Few repetitions slightly decreased the attentional shift toward the target stimulus, many repetitions increased it."

We found that these cognitive constructs collectively accounted for % of the variance in math and % in science achievement, even after adjusting for gender, socioeconomic status, and country fixed effects. This means that the majority of cultural differences in math and science achievement can be explained by cognitive constructs employed in reading. We also noted that, at the country level, coefficients of cognitive constructs employed in reading demonstrated an interesting reconciliatory pattern. Countries with a weaker coefficient on the “locating information” dimension tended to have stronger coefficients on the “understanding” and “evaluation and reflection” dimensions; whereas, countries with a stronger coefficient on “understanding” dimension tended to have a weaker coefficient on “evaluation and reflection” dimension. These findings are particularly significant for STEM interventions aiming to enhance math and science achievement, as they indicate that a substantial portion of the variance in these achievements can be explained by cognitive constructs employed in reading literacy.

We have looked for five schemas in the scores for the first ten piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven and three famous analytical and pedagogical texts about them: force, indicating changes in musical dynamics and referential invocation of power-related terms in the books; path, identifying vertical movement in the music and suggestions of upward- or downward motion in the texts; link, suggesting the presence or absence of musical slurs and references to attachment or detachment in the language; balance, indicating the loss and regain of consonance in the harmony and invocation of lost and recovered stability in the verbal semantics; and containment, allocating the nonharmonic tones that “belong” to their resolving notes in the scores and referring to physical or metaphorical enclosed areas in the texts. Results of the corpus analysis suggest the following conclusions: musical schemas outnumber linguistic ones sevenfold; moderate schema strengths are typical of both language and music; predominant valences are shared by language and music in three schemas out of five; hierarchies of five schemas by strength differ, though the strongest schemas are mostly shared. Yet the central finding is that the correlations between each schema pair for music and language, by scalarity and valence, are total. This implies that schemas operate as semantic building blocks irrespective of the external “symbolical form” in which they are realized and scalarized image schema complexes perceived in one cognitive mode may motivate the emergence of a corresponding number of the same complexes in another."

Transportation is a well-established psychological theory and framework utilized to elucidate and anticipate audience engagement and enjoyment in the cognitive process of experiencing a narrative text. Although there is a substantial body of literature on transportation and media enjoyment, there is a noticeable absence of studies on the relationship between audiences being “transported” into the narrative world of TV dramas and, particularly, the pleasure audiences derive from interacting with media content within a cross-cultural acceptance context.MethodThe research employs a quantitative design, with responses collected from students enrolled at a Malaysian public university. It aims to validate the influence of social norms, cultural identity, and affective disposition on narrative immersion while watching foreign TV dramas, as well as the subsequent enjoyment of media among local audiences.ResultsThe results indicate that social norms, cultural identity, and affective disposition significantly influence transportation and enjoyment. Furthermore, the influence of cultural identity on social norms has a positive moderating effect on transportation.DiscussionStorytelling that complies with social norms while offering new perspectives can maximally engage audiences, potentially altering their narrative cognition and deepening their immersion in fictional narratives. Cultural identity can shape audience perceptions and reactions to cross-cultural media consumption, ultimately influencing the degree to which audiences are drawn into the narrative. Furthermore, the audience’s emotional connection to characters in the narrative or to situations in the drama significantly influences the overall cognitive and immersion levels."

In contrast to ordinary “little-c” creativity, depictions of profound creative moments and the means by which they can be attained therefore remain as enigmatic as acts of mystical prayer. Pursuing this metaphor: with little-p equating to ordinary prayer and Big-P equating to mystical prayer, from the work of St. John Cassian and Thomas Merton, we contrast the developmental path of prayer with subjective accounts of little-c and Big-C moments of creativity in the lives of famous th century Anglophone artist-musicians. Here, we identify a symmetry between the aetiology of prayer and creativity. As with little-p, the development of little-c creativity is sequential, tracing a path from authenticity to task motivation, to practice and then experience. By contrast, akin to Big-P, Big-C creativity may be obtained moving from authenticity to task motivation, but thereafter circumventing the requirements of elevated practice and experience. Moreover, in moments of extreme creativity, artists manifest a profound surrender of agency as Big-C emerges spontaneously with minimal deliberate thought and an absence of ownership. Thus, drawing on the insights of Cassian-Merton, we present a historically grounded perspective on the spontaneous and enigmatic emergence of Big-C creativity."

However, the transition from school to university is a stressful experience for students, marked by significant challenges. Although literature acknowledges these challenges, limited research has focused specifically on the role of hope during this period. Additionally, previous studies on hope have often utilized individualistic approaches, which may not fully capture the experience of students in collectivist cultures. This study addresses this gap by exploring hope from a culturally sensitive perspective within a collectivist context, aiming to understand how first-year South African university students experience hope during the transition to university.MethodsThis study employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore the lived experiences of hope among first-year South African university students during their transition to higher education. Twenty-two students participated in semi-structured interviews, allowing for an in-depth examination of their personal and cultural perspectives on hope and the challenges they faced. The data were analyzed iteratively, with strategies implemented to enhance trustworthiness and credibility, ensuring a thorough interpretation of students’ experiences.ResultsThe analysis yielded three main themes: Affective and Social Duality: Students described mixed emotions and social challenges as they entered university, highlighting the dual nature of their experiences in adapting to a new environment. Hope as a Multifaceted Concept: Hope was portrayed as a guiding force that helped students navigate periods of uncertainty. Participants described hope not just as a single idea but as a complex, evolving concept crucial to their resilience. Beyond Academic Aspirations: Hope extended beyond academic success and was closely tied to personal fulfilment and the desire to contribute positively to society. This broader perspective on hope suggests that students’ aspirations were not confined to individual achievement but also included a sense of collective and societal impact.DiscussionThe study reveals that hope is a multidimensional construct that significantly influences students’ transitional experiences, extending beyond academic goals to include personal growth and societal contributions. This finding challenges the traditional, individualistic approaches to studying hope by highlighting the cultural relevance of collectivist values in shaping students’ experiences. The study underscores the need for culturally sensitive research and suggests that student support services should consider cultural contexts to address students’ unique challenges and aspirations better. Future research is recommended to explore hope across various cultural backgrounds to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its role in student development."

Teachers are pivotal in this transmission process via their value-related educational goals , which outline how they would like to see their pupils in terms of values. What factors influence these VrEGs? We suggest that those vary on an individual level, but also correspond to the prevailing value orientations of the society. In our study we followed two main goals to test this thesis. Firstly, we examine the differences in VrEGs between teachers of two European countries: Switzerland and United Kingdom . Secondly, we investigated the similarity of the teachers’ VrEGs with prevailing national value orientations from the specific countries. One hundred and fifty primary school teachers were asked about their VrEGs using an adapted version of Schwartz’s Portrait Values Questionnaire . Data from the Human Value Scale of the European Social Survey was used for country-specific value orientations. Analyses of the value structures and the differences in value priorities showed that for the individuals from the two countries as well as for the teachers’ VrEGs from the two countries, significant differences exist in several value types. Teachers’ VrEGs in each country showed a high correlation with the corresponding national value profile. We discuss our results in light of cross-national differences in value education in schools."

We also explored whether these two types of emotional expression and general trust mediate the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and happiness/loneliness.MethodsAmerican and Japanese participants who agreed to participate in the current study first completed the Subjective Happiness Scale. Next, they answered the Emotion Expression Questionnaire, the -item General Trust Scale, and the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. They then responded to the Risky Family Questionnaire. Finally, they answered demographic questions . We hypothesized that regardless of culture, adverse childhood experiences would be negatively associated with happiness , while positive emotional expression in personal and social settings and general trust would be positively related to happiness . We also predicted that positive emotional expression in both personal and social settings, as well as general trust, would mediate the relationships between adverse childhood experiences and happiness/loneliness.ResultsAs expected, adverse childhood experiences were negatively associated with happiness , while positive emotional expression in personal and social settings and general trust were positively related to happiness . Besides, positive emotional expression in a personal situation mediated the relationships between adverse childhood experiences and happiness/loneliness, such that greater early life adversity was negatively linked to positive emotional expressivity in a personal setting, which, in turn, predicted lower happiness and higher loneliness.DiscussionThe present study advances the understanding of psychological mechanisms linking adverse childhood experiences to happiness and loneliness by highlighting the significant role of positive emotional expression in a personal situation.

Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted using PROCESS macro.ResultsChinese participants demonstrated higher DM levels than Indonesian participants. In the Chinese sample, both perspective taking and empathic concern mediated DM’s effects on prosocial behavior toward family , friends , and strangers . However, in the Indonesian sample, PT and EC only mediated effects on PBFr. Cultural background significantly moderated DM’s indirect effect on PBS through PT, with stronger effects in the Chinese sample. Fantasy and personal distress showed no significant mediating effects in either cultural context.ConclusionThis study reveals that DM enhances prosocial behavior through selective influence on different empathy dimensions, with cultural background moderating specific pathways.

Previous studies have demonstrated that a task-irrelevant stimulus, which functions as contextual information, can be integrated in various ways. In some cases, the context modulated the binding between a stimulus and a response, resulting in a configural binding structure. In other cases, the context was found to be directly bound with the response in a binary fashion. The current study examined the integration of context within a stimulus-response episode, with a focus on the role of inter-trial variability. Specifically, the context variability was manipulated across five experimental groups, ranging from the minimum to the maximum level. The minimum-variability group maintained a consistent pattern of two context tones per block, while the maximum-variability group used a uniformly random order of eight different context tones. Intermediate groups progressively employed greater degrees of variability in the presentation of contextual stimuli. Results showed that the integration of context changed as a function of its variability level: The contextual stimuli with minimal to low level of variability did not exhibit a pattern of integration, while those with moderate to high variability were involved in a configural binding with another stimulus and the response. Only when the context exhibited maximal variability did it become directly bound with the response in a binary fashion. The current findings extend previous assumptions about saliency thresholds for stimulus integration into the realm of inter-trial variability and underscore the role of stimulus uncertainty in shaping context integration. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed."

Since the cognitive demands experienced by pilots fluctuate throughout a given flight due to changes in task demands that range from high to low cognitive load, it has become increasingly important to objectively track and quantify these changes accordingly. The analysis of eye movements has been shown to be a promising method to understand information acquisition, processing efficiency, and how these aspects of cognition impact pilot performance. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the impact of a dual task paradigm on low-time pilot flight performance and gaze behavior during two phases of flight with varying levels of cognitive load. Twenty-two licensed pilots completed simulated flight circuits alongside an auditory oddball task under visual flight rules conditions. Self-reported situation awareness scores and auditory task performance revealed the dual task was more demanding than the single tasks. Flight performance and gaze behavior indicated that primary task performance and information processing remained unaffected. These results suggest that the recruited pilots attained a level of skill proficiency that enabled the efficient deployment of cognitive resources to successfully complete the flying task under states of increased cognitive load. Combined with previous research findings, the results suggest that the effect of secondary tasks depends on the type of tasks used . The utility of using a dual task and gaze behavior to probe flight proficiency and information processing efficiency throughout training are discussed."

The test features equivalent -line passages made up of unrelated words, adhering to the principles established by the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test in English .AimTo develop a short Italian version of the WRRT , and to determine the equivalence across the new, shorter passages of text. The introduction of -line passages, instead of the original -line ones, aims to enhance the tool's suitability for the elderly or neuropsychological patients by reducing administration time.MethodThe same high-frequency Italian words from the standard Italian WRRT were used to generate -line passages for the SI-WRRT. Comprehensive eye examination and vision assessment, including the Radner Reading Charts, were performed before the administration of the SI-WRRT. Forty healthy Italian-speaking higher education students read the SI-WRRT passages aloud in random order. Reading speed and accuracy were measured offline from digital recordings of the readings. Equivalence across passages and the effects of practice and fatigue were assessed for reading speed and accuracy, along with test-retest reliability.ResultsNo significant difference in reading speed was found across out of the passages. In addition, no differences were observed in accuracy, and the error rate was very low. Practice and fatigue effects were minimal for reading speed, whereas they were absent for accuracy. Reading speed, the reference metric for the WRRT, showed moderate-to-good test-retest reliability.ConclusionsEquivalence was confirmed across passages of the SI-WRRT. Therefore, the test may be suitable for examining the elderly or neuropsychological patients, as reading time of the -line passages is halved with respect to the standard Italian WRRT. However, the -line passages still allow the assessment of prolonged reading. Since one passage was not equivalent, we recommend avoiding the use of random rearrangements of words without formally checking their validity."

Without timely intervention, these mild to moderate emotional issues may escalate into more severe conditions. Social-Emotional Learning programs are effective for building social-emotional skills. However, current research on SEL programs has not adequately addressed the issue of high-quality teacher-student interactions for students who suffer emotional problems. To tackle this issue, this study proposes a curriculum approach that integrates mindfulness with rhythmic music? and evaluated the emotional changes of students after mindfulness with rhythmic music curriculum.MethodsThis study adopted a pre-post experimental design. Two hundred and ninety-four firefighting universities students participated in a one-semester “online mindfulness combined with music rhythm SEL course”. The study used the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Perceived Stress Scale to measure the anxiety, depression and stress levels of the participants before and after the course, and used the participants' self-reflection reports as a method to explore the students' emotional transformation patterns.ResultsThe research findings indicate that: eighth-note, quarter-note, and sixteenth-note rhythmic music significantly improve the emotional wellbeing of students with depression, anxiety, and stress imbalances, respectively. The degree of emotional improvement has a certain impact on academic performance. Students with anxiety require more instructional support focused on attention concentration during the early phases of the course; students with depression should not be scheduled for social skills learning modules in the short term and need long-term instructional guidance; individuals experiencing stress imbalances require attention to their personal music preferences and benefit from additional listening activities and exercise.DiscussionThese findings assist teachers in accurately identifying emotional changes among students with emotional problems and managing the patterns of these emotional transitions, thereby providing effective instructional support and promoting high-quality interactions between teachers and students."

Neonatal intensive care unit care has become indispensable for these newborns. Nevertheless, this mode of care poses substantial economic, psychological, and health challenges to the families of preterm infants. Despite abundant evidence concerning the parents’ needs in the NICU, the needs of grandparents—vital family members—are frequently disregarded. This exploratory study aimed to assess the grandparents’ needs of preterm infants in the NICU, exploring the impact of demographic elements on these needs to offer guidance for clinical care practices.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional design and the Chinese version of the NICU Family Needs Inventory to investigate the needs of grandparents. A total of grandparents participated in the study, providing data by completing structured questionnaires related to their demographic profiles and needs. Statistical analyses were utilized to analyze the data, including descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, Pearson’s correlation, and multiple linear regression.ResultsSix items about Assurance emerged as significant among the top important needs, with two items for Information, one for Proximity, and one for Support; among the least important needs, nine items related to Comfort and Support were identified. The subscale “Assurance” achieved the highest mean score of . ± ., followed by the subscales of “Information” and “Proximity,” registering mean scores of . ± . and . ± ., respectively. This explorative study identified a correlation between the needs for Assurance and employment status, place of residence, gestational age, and birth weight . Employment status, place of residence, and gestational age were identified as significant correlates for Assurance .ConclusionThe foremost need identified by grandparents is Assurance of quality care for preterm infants, closely followed by the demand for thorough Information and the ability to be in Proximity to the infant. This exploratory study highlights that mitigating the strain on families with preterm infants, as well as recognizing and meeting the needs of grandparents, is of paramount importance."

They can also be broadly impacted by the social context in which these choices are made, making the effects of these characteristics on decision-making especially challenging to understand.MethodsHere, we developed a Generative Narrative Survey that provided participants with naturalistic scenarios that richly varied in social context and theme but that also systematically varied the characteristics of the social agents involved, followed by a question. An example of this narrative is “You’re a tourist, and you are trying to take a picture of yourself with your phone. A black male comes up to you and offers to take the photo for you. Do you hand them your phone?”ResultsAfter validating this approach using feeling thermometer measures, we found that the emotional states of others had the strongest and most consistent effect on the participants’ choices. More notably, whereas most characteristics had independent effects on decision-making, social features such as the inferred socioeconomic status of others significantly influenced the effect that race had on the participant’s judgments. Moreover, the social context of the agent’s interactions with other agents had a significant additive effect, especially when the emotional states of the agents in the scenarios contrasted. The influence of these characteristics on the participants’ choices was also markedly affected by their demographics, especially when contrasting with that of the agents involved, and were often driven by the participants’ reported political views.DiscussionTogether, these findings reveal how the mixture of social characteristics, context, and personal views influence decision-making and highlight the use of naturalistic generative narrative surveys in studying human behavior."

When female students are supported and motivated positively, it is possible for them to be successful in STEM. It is possible to say that female students are the female leadership candidates of the future. Female leader candidates can play a role in future organizational development. Female leader candidates who are supported and motivated by their environment can take their place in organizational development. There is a gap in the research literature on this subject in Türkiye. This study fills an important gap in terms of sampling, research method and data analysis.MethodIn the study, personal information form, Attitude Towards Scientific Research Scale, Multiple Intelligences Self-Perception Scale and STEM Value-Expectation Rating Scale were applied to female undergraduate students who are disadvantaged in STEM field and studying at Ege University Ödemiş Faculty of Health Sciences.ResultsIt is possible to say that most female students have positive attitudes towards scientific research. According to the research results, as the reluctance to help researchers and negative attitudes towards research increase, motivation towards STEM decreases. As positive attitudes towards research and researchers increase, motivation towards STEM increases. In addition, increases in verbal–linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence and natural intelligence lead to an increase in positive attitudes towards research and thus STEM motivation.ConclusionWhen the value expectations of future female leadership candidates for the STEM field were evaluated, it was found that .% of the students had a medium level of value expectation evaluation level for the STEM field. This situation suggests that female students are not positively motivated for STEM in the family, school and peer environment."

This mixed-methods study investigates these changes over three periods—pre-pandemic, pandemic onset, and one-year post-onset—to understand their causes and inform public health policy for improved resilience during future crises.MethodsA mixed-methods study was conducted with US participants who completed open-ended qualitative questions and quantitative assessments in May and May . Participants were recruited via social media from states with high COVID- cases. Quantitative data categorized health changes , while qualitative data were analyzed thematically to explore reasons for these changes and uncover interrelationships among health behaviors.ResultsQuantitative results showed that, during the pandemic onset, most participants experienced negative changes in diet, mental well-being, and sleep, while physical activity varied. By one-year post-onset, improvements were noted across all health pillars, with mental well-being and sleep showing the most significant positive changes. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed stress, anxiety, and personal motivations as key drivers of health behaviors. Participants’ narratives provided a deeper understanding of these shifts that a Likert-style survey alone could not capture, highlighting the interconnectedness of health pillars.DiscussionThe findings demonstrate the importance of addressing mental well-being to improve overall health resilience. Public health interventions should prioritize mental health and consider the interrelated nature of health behaviors. The mixed-methods approach combined quantitative trends with qualitative insights, offering a comprehensive understanding of why health changes occurred, providing actionable guidance for future public health policy."

The importance of living a meaningful and purposeful life cannot be overstressed, especially for adolescents who are in a critical life stage and have recently experienced a -year-long global health crisis, namely the COVID- pandemic. Although previous studies have examined adolescents’ MIL, the majority of them adopted a variable-centered approach. The present study adopts a person-centered approach to investigate the updated MIL among Chinese adolescents in the aftermath of the COVID- pandemic, the demographic factors related to profile classification, and the differences in mental health among adolescents in different MIL classes.MethodsA questionnaire assessing MIL, depression, anxiety, stress, and demographic information was administered to , Chinese adolescents . A three-step latent profile analysis was conducted.Results and discussionThis study revealed that adolescents can be categorized into three classes: high MIL, medium MIL, and low and searching MIL. Adolescents from intact families with higher educated mothers were more likely to be classified as high MIL class rather than low MIL class. Furthermore, adolescents with high MIL experienced the best mental health outcomes, those with medium MIL experienced moderate mental health, and those with low MIL, who were still searching for MIL, exhibited the poorest mental health. External support may be necessary in the search process for Chinese adolescents. Future research could explore the process of searching for MIL and identify the challenges adolescents encounter when developing their sense of MIL."

In , X initiated its community-driven fact-checking program, named Community Notes . This program allows users to create contextual and corrective notes for misleading posts and rate the helpfulness of others' contributions. The effectiveness of the platform has been preliminarily verified, but mixed findings on reliability indicate the need for further research.ObjectiveThe study aims to assess the reliability of Community Notes by comparing the readability and language neutrality of helpful and unhelpful notes.MethodsA total of , helpful notes and , unhelpful notes spanning from January , , to May , were collected. Measures of reading ease, analytical thinking, affect and authenticity were derived by means of Wordless and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count . Subsequently, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was employed to evaluate the differences between the helpful and unhelpful groups.ResultsBoth groups of notes are easy to read with no notable difference. Helpful notes show significantly greater logical thinking, authenticity, and emotional restraint than unhelpful ones. As such, the reliability of Community Notes is validated in terms of readability and neutrality. Nevertheless, the prevalence of prepared, negative and swear language in unhelpful notes indicates the manipulative and abusive attempts on the platform. The wide value range in the unhelpful group and overall limited consensus on note helpfulness also suggest the complex information ecology within the crowdsourced platform, highlighting the necessity of further guidance and management.ConclusionBased on the statistical analysis of the linguistic and psycholinguistic characteristics, the study validated the reliability of Community Notes and identified room for improvement. Future endeavors could explore the psychological motivations underlying volunteering, gaming, or even manipulative behaviors, enhance the crowdsourced debunking system and integrate it with broader efforts in infodemic management."

However, limited research has focused on the role of psychological evaluation within EPC. The Veneto Institute of Oncology , a Comprehensive Cancer Centre, employs an interdisciplinary team to assess patients with advanced-stage disease. This study aims to assess the psychological needs of these patients, investigate any correlations between psychological symptoms and factors such as awareness of diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms detected using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System , as well as the patient’s gender, age, social issues, and survival and to clarify the psychologist’s role within the interdisciplinary team.MethodsData were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. From st January to st December , consecutive patients were evaluated during EPC consultations, with participants enrolled in the study. The ESAS was administered to each patient before the consultation.ResultsMore than half of the patients reported at least one PS, with an ESAS score of ≥. Specifically, .% reported depression, .% reported anxiety, and .% indicated feeling “not well.” Referring oncologists tended to overestimate the presence of PSs compared to patient self-reports . According to the psychologists’ assessment, .% of participants were found to have depression, and .% of participants had anxiety. Additionally, patients with psychological disorders were diagnosed with an adaptation disorder related to a physical condition. The psychology service engaged % of patients, while .% declined psychological support. Patients exhibiting other ESAS symptoms with scores of ≥ had an increased odds ratio for reporting PSs of ≥. However, multivariable analysis revealed no significant relationship between PSs and awareness of diagnosis and prognosis.ConclusionThe systematic use of self-assessment in EPC is essential for understanding patient’s experience, determining whether PSs stem from physical disorders, and prioritizing interventions. Awareness of prognosis does not correlate with increased anxiety and depression in patients. Therefore, EPC is an ideal opportunity to discuss prognosis and facilitate patients’ end-of-life choices early in their care journey."

Numerous studies indicate emotional regulation difficulties in both attachment avoidance and anxiety. Additionally, emotional Event-Related Potentials , such as the Late Positive Potential , reveal the process of emotional information at the cerebral level, and thus, LPP is commonly used in studies examining emotion regulation processes. For instance, when individuals are asked to use cognitive strategies to increase, maintain, or decrease their emotional responses to stimuli, changes in LPP amplitude can reflect the effectiveness of these regulation strategies. However, little is known about the potential moderating effect of the LPP during the implementation of emotional regulation strategies in the relationship between attachment dimensions and emotional dysregulation. To address this oversight, the purpose of the present study was to examine the association between both dimensions of attachment, anxiety and avoidance, and emotional dysregulation, as well as the moderating role of the LPP during the induced implementation of cognitive reappraisal.MethodsBrain activity was recorded using EEG from n = adults while they performed a task in which they were instructed to either reappraise or suppress emotions elicited by unpleasant images. To assess the associations between LPP, emotional dysregulation, and attachment orientations, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Spanish version and the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire were used.ResultsInterestingly, we found that greater LPP amplitudes during reappraisal implementation intensified the association between attachment anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties. Conversely, this relationship was non-significant under lower levels of LPP amplitude—Providing supporting evidence for the moderating role of LPP.DiscussionOur results highlight how attachment anxiety can influence the ability to regulate emotions. This study provides new insights into how variations in LPP contribute to the effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies."

However, most existing studies explore the relationship between these variables in isolation without examining whether Approximate Number System mediates the relationship between Executive Function and the Cardinality Principle and the role of age in this. This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the mediating role of the Approximate Number System in the relationship between Executive Function and the Cardinality Principle and the moderating role of age in young children.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in China from February to June . A total of young children participated. Participants were assessed using a range of tests: the Day-Night Stroop Task, Digit Recall Task, Dimensional Change Card Sort Task, Panamath Test Software, How Many Task, and Give-N Task to measure Executive Function, Approximate Number System, and Cardinality Principle. Data were analyzed using SPSS . and PROCESS v. to explore the relationships among Executive Function, the Approximate Number System, and the Cardinality Principle through Pearson correlations, multivariate regression, and mediation analysis with bootstrap samples.ResultsCorrelation analysis revealed that the Cardinality Principle was significantly and positively correlated with Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, Cognitive Flexibility, Executive Function, and the Approximate Number System. Regression analyses indicated that Executive Function positively predicted young children's Cardinality Principle. Specifically, Working Memory and Cognitive Flexibility were positive predictors of the Cardinality Principle, while Inhibitory Control was not. Mediation analysis results demonstrated that the Approximate Number System mediated the relationships between Inhibitory Control and the Cardinality Principle, Working Memory and the Cardinality Principle, and Cognitive Flexibility and the Cardinality Principle, respectively. In addition, the study found that young children's age negatively moderated the relationship between the Approximate Number System and the Cardinality Principle.ConclusionsThe study emphasizes that in developing young children's Cardinality Principle, emphasis should be placed on improving their Executive Function and Approximate Number System while considering the age differences of young children and developing appropriate educational methods for different age groups."

The findings from , participants across four societies—China, India, Taiwan, and the United States—support our hypothesis that strong-ties rationalities, when activated, will endorse strong-tie values and beliefs.

Past research on mental health assessment has primarily focused on psychopathological aspects such as depression or anxiety. In recent years, however, scholars in positive psychology have suggested that this may ignore the impact of individuals' positive psychological qualities, such as well-being. ""Flourishing"" is a novel concept in the field of wellbeing. This adds to psychological well-being based on traditional social and subjective well-being. However, limited research has focused on the flourishing of older Chinese community-dwelling adults from the perspective of positive psychology. Therefore, this study explored the status and factors influencing flourishing among older Chinese community-dwelling adults. Methods: A total of community-dwelling older adults living in Chengdu between January and March were included in this study through a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed the General Condition Questionnaire and the Flourishing Scale. The data were collected and recorded in a database using a two-person input format. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS Windows software version .. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to identify the factors influencing flourishing. Results: The mean score of the flourishing scale among Chinese community-dwelling older adults was . ± .. Univariate analysis showed that economic condition, education level, spousal state, social participation, daily exercise, and chronic disease were significantly associated with flourishing among community-dwelling older adults. In contrast, gender, place of residence, and living state were not. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that economic condition , education level , spousal state , social participation , daily exercise , and chronic disease were significant influence factors of flourishing among community-dwelling older adults. Conclusions: This study is one of the first to explore the growth of community-dwelling older adults in China. The findings of this study make essential contributions to existing research on well-being. Interventions targeting older adults with poor economic conditions, lower educational levels, chronic diseases, limited social participation, and widowed or living alone are necessary."

Ruminative thinking, i.e., the tendency to dwell on particular issues or ideas, may affect the perceived aversiveness and ability to cope with adverse life events. However, the role that rumination plays in the relationship between adverse life events and the presence of PLEs remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to assess the association between adverse life events and PLEs in a longitudinal sample of young adults and adolescents, and to investigate whether this relationship is mediated by ruminative thinking.MethodsWe used a longitudinal naturalistic sample of volunteers assessed at ages and years, within the Imagen consortium. Lifetime occurrence of adverse life events was investigated using the Life Events Questionnaire. The Community Assessment of Psychic Experience served to assess the presence of PLEs, while ruminative thinking was investigated through the Ruminative Response Scale.ResultsResults showed that both frequency of PLEs and their persistence over time were associated with greater adverse life events exposure and greater ruminative response . Mediation analyses showed that relationship between adverse life events and PLEs frequency was partially mediated by rumination . Considering changes between the two assessment timepoints, relationship between PLEs variation between and years and adverse life events occurred during the same period was partially mediated by changes in rumination .DiscussionOverall, our findings confirm that the presence of adverse life events may increase the risk of experiencing PLEs in healthy individuals and suggest that dysfunctional coping strategies, such as ruminative thinking, may be related to psychosis proneness. Results do not disentangle whether individuals with greater risk for psychosis tend to ruminate more or whether rumination exacerbates psychosis risk."

This study aims to evaluate the economic efficiency of the cultural industry in Jiangsu Province by establishing a Data Envelopment Analysis model and analyzing influencing factors using the Tobit model, all within the broader context of China’s cultural industry.MethodsA DEA model was developed to assess the economic efficiency of the cultural industry across Chinese provinces, allowing for a comparative analysis of performance. The Tobit regression model was utilized to investigate factors influencing these efficiency outcomes, with a particular emphasis on inter-provincial comparisons to understand the position and challenges faced by Jiangsu’s cultural industry.ResultsDespite Jiangsu’s cultural industry ranking among the largest in scale nationally, its economic efficiency is only moderate, consistently experiencing diminishing returns to scale. The study identifies low scale efficiency, small enterprise size, and suboptimal urbanization processes within the province as the main issues.DiscussionThe inefficiencies highlighted by the DEA model suggest a misalignment between the scale of operations and the economic outputs in Jiangsu’s cultural industry. Urbanization emerges as a crucial factor, with current practices not sufficiently supporting the growth potential of the cultural sector.ConclusionBased on these findings, the study proposes targeted policy recommendations for Jiangsu, including avoiding blind scale expansion, adjusting industrial structures, encouraging enterprise consolidation and optimization, and identifying new growth areas to better support the cultural industry’s development and contribute to sustainable economic progress."

When we observe a stereogram in which the stimulus configurations induce stereopsis and rivalry simultaneously, the binocular system prefers stereopsis to rivalry. However, changes in visual perception are yet to be investigated by parametrically manipulating the components of a stereogram.MethodsWe examined stereopsis preferences in stereograms with various horizontal disparities. The stereograms of our paradigms included horizontal and vertical bars in one eye and a vertical bar alone in the other. Under experimental conditions, the vertical bar superimposed on the horizontal bar varied its position relative to the opposite vertical bar: range of horizontal disparity, .′ to .′. The superimposed vertical bar was absent under the control condition. Observers were instructed to indicate the disappearance of monocular horizontal bars, that is, targets, from their perception during the -s trials.ResultsThe total disappearance duration decreased under experimental conditions compared with that under control conditions, and it gradually increased with an increase in the disparity of the stereoscopic vertical bars.DiscussionThese results indicate that the disparity in the stereoscopic components biases binocular perception away from the rivalry between the vertical and horizontal bars toward the stereopsis of the vertical bars. Furthermore, the disappearance duration showed a unimodal and asymmetric distribution across all disparity conditions. This suggests that rivalry processing occurs in parallel when stereopsis is dominant. We found that stereopsis preference is an outcome of binocular perception selection biased by disparity."

These pressures not only stem from an escalation in research tasks but also from urgent demands for innovative outputs. Grounded in Affective Events Theory, this study explores the dual impact of time pressure on the innovative behaviors of doctoral students in China. It specifically examines how challenge and hindrance time pressures affect doctoral students’ innovative behavior through the mediating role of research self-efficacy and the moderating role of supervisor support. This research employed SPSS . and Mplus . for statistical analysis, analyzing multi-time point data collected from Chinese doctoral students between May and August . The results reveal that challenge time pressure significantly positively impacts doctoral students’ innovative behavior, while hindrance time pressure has a significant negative impact. Furthermore, research self-efficacy partially mediates the relationship between both challenge and hindrance time pressures and innovative behavior. In this process, the moderating role of supervisor support is significant, enhancing the positive effects of challenge time pressure and mitigating the negative impacts of hindrance time pressure, highlighting the importance of supervisor support in optimizing the impact of time pressure and promoting doctoral students’ innovative behavior. These findings not only enrich the theoretical framework in the field of time pressure research but also provide practical guidance for universities and supervisors on how to support doctoral students in effectively managing time pressure and fostering their innovation."

Although there is a great deal of research in second language writing on the effect of scaffolding on improving students’ writing outcome variables , few studies have explored the contributions of scaffolding to learners’ emotions and psychological variables. Using a double pre-test post-test design, this quasi-experimental study investigated the effect of a scaffolded writing intervention on students’ self-efficacy beliefs in source-based argumentative writing. We analyzed the students’ source-self-efficacy beliefs weeks before the intervention, immediately before the intervention, and immediately after the intervention. At the end of the intervention, students’ performance was measured using a scoring rubric containing key criteria in source-based argumentative writing. A post-study semi-structured interview was conducted with participating students to further understand their experience with the scaffolding intervention. The analyses demonstrated that the intervention had a positive and significant impact on students’ self-efficacy beliefs of their abilities to organize ideas, summarize different sources, and revise their essays. There were no significant changes in the participants’ beliefs about skills related to deciding if the evidence from different sources is strong, finding weaknesses in the arguments presented in different sources, and writing a counterargument. Furthermore, correlational analysis using post-test self-efficacy overall score and students’ writing performance scores on four major aspects revealed a positive relationship between self-efficacy and two aspects of writing . Students’ interview results further confirmed the effectiveness of the intervention in enhancing the participants’ self-efficacy beliefs and performance in source-based argumentative writing.

Building on compensatory Internet use theory, this study introduces an extended model to explore how stress, compensatory motivations , and affective responses relate to short video addiction. This study also examines differences between the age groups.MethodsData from Chinese short video users were tested applying partial least squares structural equation modeling and PLS-SEM multigroup analysis.ResultsFindings indicate that stress, immersion, and attitude each contribute positively to short video addiction. Stress is linked to both social interaction and relaxing entertainment. While both factors positively affect attitude toward short videos, only relaxing entertainment enhances immersion. Results confirmed the perceived stress indirectly influences short video addiction through a serial mediating pathway comprising motivations and affective responses. Moreover, the study shows that perceived stress influences social interaction, relaxing entertainment influences attitude and immersion, and social interaction influences immersion across all age groups.

The self-regulated behavior change stage model proposes that people who intend to change their behavior progress through a series of discrete cognitive stages until, ultimately, they engage in the new behavior. However, what the consequences of habitual behaviors are for the initiation and progression through the stages of change have not yet been fully elucidated or investigated. We hypothesized that habitual behaviors that are antagonistic toward an alternative behavior will inhibit the initiation and progression through the stages of change. Furthermore, in line with the habit discontinuity hypothesis, we hypothesized that the experience of life events would counteract antagonistic habits and be positively associated with stages of change. Using a cross-sectional survey of people who consume red meat in the UK, our findings support the SSBC concept of stage-specific cognitive processes with goal intention and goal feasibility varying in importance depending on stage membership. However, personal norms were equally important for stage membership regardless of stage. Our hypotheses for antagonistic habits and life events were also partially supported; the antagonistic habit was not negatively associated with goal intention to change, but it was associated with a reduced likelihood of being in the final stage of change . Experience of a life event was positively associated with goal intention to change, but it was negatively associated with being in a later stage of change. Overall, our findings provide novel theoretical insights into the role of habits and habit disruption in a stage model of behavior change. They also yield applied implications for understanding how to achieve a reduction in the over-consumption of red meat by supporting the importance of stage-tailored behavior change interventions and suggesting the potential to combine such stage-tailored intervention strategies with the strategy of targeting interventions to when existing habits are weakened due to context disruption."

Every additional reported recent SLE increased the odds of mild, moderate, and severe depression and anxiety symptoms. Similar trends were found with distant SLEs and depression and anxiety . Furthermore, a higher number of recent and distant SLEs were associated with lower quality of life . The relationship between mental distress and quality of life of recent SLEs seems stronger than the one from distant SLEs, and recent SLEs may have a higher impact on adolescents’ mental health compared with young adults.ConclusionBoth recent and distant SLEs are related to mental distress and quality of life. Policies and programmes should aim to enhance public and health safety, as well as improve individual, family, and community protective factors that could mitigate the effect of SLEs on Latin American youth."

This instructional strategy assumes a pivotal role in imparting indispensable medical knowledge to students within a meticulously structured and all-encompassing framework.ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a novel teaching approach that integrates the three action teaching model with learning plan guidance within a preventive medicine course. Through this investigation, empirical evidence will be provided regarding the impact of utilizing learning guided by the three action teaching model with learning plan guidance as an innovative instructional method, thereby shedding light on its potential to enhance students’ autonomous learning in the field of preventive medicine.MethodsThe control group consisted of students from Class of clinical medicine in grade , who were taught using the traditional classroom teaching mode. Meanwhile, Class served as the experimental group comprising individuals, who received instruction through the three-action teaching model with learning plan guidance. Evaluation was conducted using course tests and questionnaires, and data analysis was performed utilizing t-tests, analysis of variance, and rank sum tests in SPSS software.ResultsThe average total score of the test group was significantly higher than that of the control group . Moreover, there were more experimental groups with total scores ranging from to and to compared to the control group . The Subjective Evaluation System indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of total scores , demonstrating superior performance in learning methods, emotions, engagement, and performance metrics . Specifically, analysis using the Biggs study process questionnaire revealed that the experimental group exhibited higher levels of deep learning and lower levels of superficial learning when compared to the control group.ConclusionThe implementation of a novel teaching approach that integrates the three-action teaching model with learning plan guidance significantly enhances students’ academic achievements and fosters their intrinsic motivation for learning. The success of this pedagogical method can be attributed to the enhanced classroom efficiency exhibited by teachers as well as the heightened enthusiasm for learning displayed by students."

Both entail an influence of the target trajectory’s incidence angle on the observed interceptive hand movements along the interception axis; they differ in the interception location considered. The AoA effect concerns all trajectory conditions requiring hand movement to allow successful interception, while the RM effect concerns the particular condition where the target will in fact arrive at the hand’s initial position and no hand movement is therefore required but nevertheless regularly produced. Whereas the AoA effect has been systematically replicated, the RM effect has not. To determine whether the RM effect is in fact a reproducible phenomenon, we deployed a procedure enhancing the uncertainty about the target’s future arrival locations with respect to the hand’s initial position and included low-to-high target motion speeds. Results demonstrated the presence of both the AoA effect and the RM effect. The AoA effect was observed for all relevant interception locations, with the effect being stronger for the farther interception locations and the lower target speeds. The RM effect, with the hand first moving away from its initial position, in the direction of the target, before reversing direction, was observed in a higher proportion of trials for target trajectories with larger incidence angles and lower speeds. Earlier initiation gave rise to reversal movements of larger amplitude. Both effects point to visual guidance of hand movement partially based in reliance on information with respect to current lateral ball position. We conclude that the information used in lateral manual interception is of an intermediate order, which can be conceived as resulting from a partial combination of target position and velocity information or information in the form of a fractional order derivative."

Climate emotions have a critical albeit complex role in modulating pro-environmental behavior. Moreover, ideological frames, particularly those from world religions, exert strong influence on pro-environmental behavior, covering most of humanity. Among these, Buddhism has long been argued to contain elements suited to a green transition. However, empirical research on Buddhism and ecology is scarce, and little is known about the dynamics between climate emotions and behavior among Buddhists. In this article, we increase knowledge about the complex dynamics of climate action by analyzing findings from a case study investigating thirteen Western Buddhist climate activists, who operate at the intersection of Buddhism and environmentalism. Life history and thematic interview data shows that interpretations of Buddhism shape attitudes toward climate emotions in profound ways, with respondents manifesting high levels of emotional reflexivity. Interpretations of compassion and interconnectedness facilitate various levels of care for non-human nature. Some participants reported climate anxiety. Teachings on impermanence and cultivation of equanimity affect engagement with climate grief, anger, despair, and hope. Interpretations on karma allow negotiating a balance between individual guilt and allocation of responsibility to social structures, although the role of climate guilt emerges as somewhat conflicted among participants. Furthermore, emotion norms on avoiding anger and conflict can prevent individual and collective activation, and some participants were critical about traditional Buddhist interpretations of anger. Withdrawal into Buddhist practice with an inner focus was used to cope with uncertainty and burnout, and when seen to address the psychological roots of the climate crisis this could facilitate social disengagement. Our study contributes to interdisciplinary research on climate emotions, environmental activism, and religion."

Understanding and predicting variations in the adoption of these safeguards is crucial for both theoretical advancement and practical application. While existing frameworks are often adapted from health science literature, there is potential to enhance these models by incorporating criminological constructs relevant to online victimization. This study introduce rational choice theory of thoughtfully reflective decision-making into the information security domain. TRDM suggests that variations in cognitive decision-making capabilities influence behavioral outcomes, particularly in the context of security and privacy practices.MethodsThe study employed a field experiment to test the applicability of TRDM in predicting end-users’ engagement in security and privacy behaviors. Participants were exposed to security-related warnings, with the hypothesis that thoughtfully reflective decision-makers would be more likely to adopt robust protective behaviors. Data was collected on participants’ responses to these security warnings, as well as their overall adherence to privacy and security practices.ResultsThe findings support the theoretical framework: individuals exhibiting thoughtfully reflective decision-making tendencies demonstrated a higher likelihood of engaging in privacy and security behaviors. Specifically, participants with higher TRDM scores were more likely to adopt protective behaviors when warned of the consequences of non-compliance. These results indicate that cognitive decision-making capabilities significantly influence the likelihood of engaging in cybersecurity practices.DiscussionThe study challenges the prevailing one-size-fits-all approach to cybersecurity by highlighting the importance of individual differences in cognitive decision-making. Thoughtfully reflective decision-makers are better equipped to adopt preventive security measures, suggesting the need for more tailored interventions in cybersecurity education and risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of sophisticated risk assessment tools aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities and reducing users’ susceptibility to digital threats.

ICU nurses are key providers in hospice care, and their attitudes toward death influence the quality of end-of-life nursing. Positive psychology emphasizes promoting positive attitudes toward death. A sense of meaning in life and resilience are critical aspects of positive psychology, which are essential for shaping ICU nurses’ attitudes toward death.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate whether a sense of meaning in life indirectly affects attitudes toward death through the mediation of resilience.MethodA total of ICU nurses from four tertiary general hospitals in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, China, participated in this study. They completed an online questionnaire, including the Death Attitude Profile-Revised, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the China Meaning in Life Questionnaire for ICU nurses.ResultsICU nurses scored highest in natural acceptance , followed by escaping acceptance , and fear of death . The proposed model fit the data well. Both the presence of meaning and the search for meaning were positive predictors of resilience . Resilience, the presence of meaning, and the search for meaning positively predicted natural acceptance . Conversely, these factors negatively predicted fear of death and escaping acceptance . Mediation analysis indicated that resilience had a partial mediating role.ConclusionThe presence of meaning and the search for meaning influence attitudes toward death, with resilience serving as a partial mediator. It is recommended that nursing administrators consider ICU nurses’ attitudes toward death and emphasize the importance of meaning in life and resilience in death education.

However, no empirical study has investigated which method best estimates the reliability of single-item assessments. This study investigated this question using a simulation study. To represent assessments as they are found in practice, the simulation study varied several aspects: the item discrimination parameter, the test length of the multi-item assessment of the same construct, the sample size, and the correlation between the single-item assessment and the multi-item assessment of the same construct. The results suggest that by using the method based on the double monotonicity model and the method based on correction for attenuation simultaneously, researchers can obtain the most precise estimate of the range of reliability of a single-item assessment in .% of cases. The test length of a multi-item assessment of the same construct, the item discrimination parameter, the sample size, and the correlation between the single-item assessment and the multi-item assessment of the same construct did not influence the choice of method choice."

This study aimed to explore whether interpersonal stress would mediate the relationship between perceived COVID- crisis strength and emotional labor, and whether gender would moderate the indirect pathway between perceived COVID- crisis strength and interpersonal stress. Participants were primary-and secondary-school teachers from Guangxi, China, selected using convenient sampling method. They completed measurements regarding emotional labor, interpersonal stress, and perceived COVID- crisis strength. Results showed that perceived COVID- crisis strength was negatively associated with deep acting but not surface acting, and this association was fully mediated by interpersonal stress. Moreover, the indirect relationship between perceived COVID- crisis strength and interpersonal stress was moderated by gender, with the indirect relationship being stronger for male teachers than for female teachers. This study illuminates the psychological mechanisms underlying the association between perceived COVID- crisis strength and emotional labor, enriching our understanding of this association and gender differences among primary and secondary school teachers."

Several physiological parameters were recorded, including heart rate , heart rate variability , electrodermal activity , blood pressure , immunoglobulin A , and salivary cortisol . Additionally, the Perceived Stress Scale was administered before forest exposure. Measurements were taken before and after participants spent days fully immersed in a forest environment. To further assess stress management, participants completed a Mental Arithmetic Task before and after forest immersion, during which EDA, HRV, and HR were monitored using an Empatica E wristband. Measurements were taken at baseline, during MAT, and afterward .ResultsParticipants exhibited moderate perceived stress levels before forest immersion . Post-forest exposure, there was a significant decrease in sCort and EDA , while HRV increased , and diastolic blood pressure rose . ANOVA results from the MAT showed a significant increase in parasympathetic activity across all conditions post-immersion , except during recovery, while EDA decreased in all conditions post-forest exposure .ConclusionShinrin-yoku significantly improved stress management at a physiological level and could be a valuable intervention for individuals experiencing stress. However, longitudinal studies with a control group are necessary to determine whether these effects are sustained over time. Nonetheless, this study highlights the potential benefits of forest immersion for stress reduction by enhancing sympathovagal balance and the adaptability of the stress response system."

Governments worldwide have responded with various measures to mitigate the impact of the virus, influencing public behavior and emotional well-being. This study investigated the relationship between government actions and public reactions in terms of online search behaviors, particularly concerning psychological distress during the pandemic. The primary objective of this study was to analyze how changes in government policies during the COVID- pandemic influenced public expressions of psychological distress, as reflected in the volume of related online searches in Kuwait.MethodUtilizing Google Trends data, the study analyzed search frequencies for terms associated with psychological distress such as “anxiety” and “lockdown.” The analysis correlated these search trends with government actions using the Oxford COVID- Government Response Tracker . The study period covered March , , to October , , and involved extensive data collection and analysis using custom software in R programming.ResultsThere was a significant correlation between the stringency of government-imposed restrictions and the volume of online searches related to psychological distress. Increased searches for “lockdown” coincided with heightened government restrictions and were associated with increased searches for “anxiety,” suggesting that policy measures significantly impacted public psychological distress.ConclusionThe study concludes that governmental responses to the COVID- pandemic, measured through OxCGRT, have a measurable impact on public psychological distress, as evidenced by online search behaviors. This underscores the importance of considering psychological impacts in policymaking and suggests further research to explore this dynamic comprehensively. Future studies should focus on refining the correlation between specific types of policy measures and different expressions of psychological distress to better inform public health strategies and interventions."

The purpose of this article is to establish the use of systematic observation and lag sequential analysis as a conceptual-methodological choice to base the review of social-constructivist instructional practice that is taught in an expository format prepared by the teacher.MethodThe systematic observation of the expert’s expository session from its inception to its conclusion was approached from a mixed methods perspective as a subject of multiple case studies. A total of four postgraduate teachers were selected. A purpose-built observational instrument was constructed. The data quality was evaluated with intra-observer agreement tests by calculating Cohen’s kappa coefficient . After the data matrices for each case were obtained, all possible file aggregations of the data were performed to detect the existence of common structures in the patterns through lag sequential analysis.ResultsThe sequential patterns of replicated and common lags of the multiple cases describe the chaining of the observed events, which characterizes the participatory interaction. Twelve lag sequential patterns have been identified that function as dialogical links, generated by the probability that the category “question” is linked to the conditioned events of “speech direction” and “exchange orientation.”DiscussionHaving constructed a theoretical interpretative scheme of the replicated patterns, we discuss the results. First, the significant results of the lag sequential analysis as examples of basic patterns extracted from their way of conducting expert expository sessions. As such, they can be reviewed with the formative purpose of reflecting on their potential for change when they are understood as dialogical links of participatory interaction committed to deep learning and the development of expert autonomy. Second, there is a training step consisting of the use of self-observation and the observation that teachers can make of the expert expository task. Finally, we conclude that non-intrusive systematic observation is a good choice when channeling the gradual and renewed improvement of participatory interaction with an expert expository format and a mixed methods methodology."

This improvement is often attributed to the prioritization of information related to the focused dimension and the removal of information related to the unfocused dimension from VWM. However, it remains unclear whether the removal of the uncued dimension is necessary to observe this dimension-based RCB.MethodsIn the current study, we first manipulated the number of retro-cues to investigate this question. We used colored, oriented bars as stimuli and two sequential retro-cues oriented to different dimensions in the double-cue condition. The last presented cue in each trial was always valid. Therefore, the unfocused dimension in the first cue display was probed in double-cue trials. Experiment adopted change detection tasks and three cue type conditions . Experiment divided the single-cue condition into early- and late- cue conditions, using recall tasks to elevated probe precision. Experiment further added double-neutral and double-same cue types and eliminated the different influences of post-memory masks on each dimension respectively.ResultsResults across these experiments showed a robust pattern of no worse performances for the double-cue condition than for the single-cue condition.DiscussionBecause the dimension-based single cue benefit was observed especially in early-cue trials, we supposed that the dimension-based RCB does not require removing the unfocused dimension from VWM."

This necessitates a psychotherapeutic approach that can help to uncover, explore, and support working through unresolved emotions and experiences. Guided Imagery and Music is an in-depth music psychotherapy approach utilizing therapist-programmed music to support the client in uncovering and examining underlying and unresolved issues. The literature surrounding the use of GIM with clients in ED treatment is anecdotal and comprised primarily of clinical case studies.MethodThis secondary analysis, based on a descriptive feasibility study that integrated GIM sessions into the client’s regular ED treatment and examined transcripts from a series of sessions of eight clients.ResultsThematic analysis of the transcripts identified nine subthemes and three themes that emerged. These themes include emotional landscape , relationships , and transformation and growth . A short series of GIM sessions helped ED clients identify and address issues underlying the ED and to gain or reclaim a sense of self that enabled them to make choices for their life that support their recovery and sense of empowerment.

Twelve near-experts and amateur basketball players, wearing an eye tracker and an inertial sensor, performed shots on a basketball field, receiving the ball from a teammate, who then acted as the opponent. The trial sequence was subdivided into catching, aiming and ball flight phases. The analysis demonstrated that near-experts exhibited longer fixation durations and saccades of lower amplitude and peak velocity than amateurs. The gaze behaviour showed that all players utilized fixations during the last part of the catching phase, during most of the aiming phase, and during the final part of the ball flight phase. The greatest number of saccades was exhibited between the aiming and the ball flight phases, when the ball was released by the players. Saccades were oriented toward the teammate during the catching phase. Instead, during the aiming and ball flight phases, saccade orientations were not polarized toward a specific visual cue. In conclusion, vision plays a critical role in every aspect of the three-point shot in basketball, from catching the ball, to aiming preparation, and shot execution.

Lastly, the anti-ought-to L self, characterized by reactions to “others,” emerged in dynamic interactions between learners and contexts. This motive inspired the learner to continuously develop the possible self and gain positive learning experiences."

It is essential to address and resolve job burnout syndrome. More research is needed to understand the underlying psychological mechanisms involved in job burnout. This study introduces the concept of primary psychological need frustration to explore its impact on the psychological processes involved in job burnout.MethodsThis study adopted a qualitative research methodology based on purposive sampling and convenience sampling principles. Eight grassroots senior counselors with over years of teaching experience at a Chinese university were selected as the study cases. The data were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analyzed thoroughly via cluster analysis, which involved examining the text data word by word, sentence by sentence, line by line, and fragment by fragment. NVivo software was used to register and code the text data.ResultsThe study revealed that the subjects experienced high levels of frustration with their basic psychological needs. This frustration was evident in the coexistence of negative job characteristics and a lack of autonomy, a hostile professional environment and a lack of competence, and the negative behavior of others and relationship frustration. The study also revealed that the four types of primary psychological need frustration were strongly linked to job burnout: A lack of control motivation or motivation, the pursuit of external goals, negative behavior patterns, and the causal orientation of a controlled style. These factors positively predicted various dimensions of job burnout and positively affected the frustration of basic psychological needs.ConclusionThis study effectively explains the psychological process behind why individuals experience severe job burnout in a controlled organizational environment due to frustration with basic psychological needs. This study also highlights the internal causal relationship between primary psychological needs, frustration, and job burnout. This insight can help employees and organizations prevent and detect early job burnout syndrome and enhance employees’ occupational well-being and organizational vitality."

Of the guidelines developed, this paper discusses the two related to resilience through self-leadership practices, namely: encouraging reliance on internal sources for self-preservation; and strengthening the positive self-image of nurse faculty through management and peer support. An exploratory, sequential mixed-methods design was used to guide the development of guidelines. Enhancing nurse faculty resilience can be achieved by promoting engagement in self-leadership activities. These activities contribute to faculty members’ profound satisfaction, confidence in their knowledge, and overall competence. Resilience is enriched through practicing self-leadership in a supportive work environment and plays a crucial role in adapting to significant changes in the work environment. It has been identified as a key factor that facilitates the ability to persist against struggles and challenges in the workplace. The implementation of higher education reforms in South Africa has brought about increased workload, stress, and uncertainties to an already overwhelmed nurse faculty workforce, consisting of mainly female faculty. It is prudent that a supportive environment that empowers nurse faculty well-being and resilience be facilitated to ensure adaptation to a dynamic and competitive nursing education environment."

A particular focus lies on comparing Confucian East Asia with other world regions.MethodsData were analyzed using multiple linear regressions and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition. As measures of adolescent well-being, this study employs life satisfaction, affective well-being, and meaning in life.ResultsGlobally, adolescent well-being outcomes are found to be most strongly linked to gender, personality, relative SES, relationship quality, peer SWB, autonomy and the learning environment, as well as local cultural factors. Estimations by world region reveal several culture-specific explanations for interregional well-being gaps. In particular, notoriously low levels of life satisfaction among students from CEA countries are found to be associated with low self-efficacy, low peer well-being, as well as with high emotional interdependence compared to other world regions. Emotional interdependence is more strongly experienced among CEA adolescents compared to adolescents from any other world region. Moreover, it is found to be more strongly associated with life satisfaction in the CEA region than in any other region. In line with the former, CEA students show stronger links between other relational factors and life satisfaction compared to most other regions.ImplicationsThis study suggests that among the environmental factors that shape the experience of adolescent lives, relationship and cultural factors play key roles and are closely intertwined. Parents, educators and policymakers around the world should focus on creating a positive school environment that promotes well-being, student self-efficacy, a sense of belonging, and a safe space in which failure is accepted as part of the learning process.

A way to advance current understandings of moral judgment and decision-making may involve testing the impact of contexts that are made available to individuals presented with these archetypal dilemmas. This preliminary study focused on assessing whether the availability of factual and contextual information delivered through classical scenarios would change moral responses.MethodA total of participants were presented with sacrificial dilemmas either with a scenario or without a scenario before performing two moral tasks: one consisted in moral judgment and one was related to choice of action . In the condition with a scenario, participants were presented with a story describing the dilemma, its protagonists, their roles, the location and some background details of the situation, before answering to the two moral tasks. In the condition without a scenario, participants were only asked to perform the two moral tasks without any additional contextual elements usually provided by the scenario. Participants’ emotions were also measured before and after completing the two moral tasks.ResultsThe results indicated that the presence of a scenario did not affect moral judgments. However, the presence of a scenario significantly increased utilitarian action choices and this effect was partially mediated by an increase in the perceived plausibility of the sacrificial action. Regarding emotional reaction to dilemmas, no differences were observed between the two conditions, suggesting that emotions are mainly based on the two moral tasks.DiscussionThese findings underscore the value of carefully considering the role of factual and contextual information provided by the scenarios in moral dilemmas."

This study investigates whether social participation influences depressive symptoms via social support and whether this influence is more prominent for Syrian refugees participating primarily in coethnic networks compared to cross-ethnic networks during the early stages of resettlement.MethodsUsing data from a cohort of Syrian refugees recently resettled in Sweden, a moderated mediation analysis was conducted with multigroup structural equation modelling to investigate the mediatory role of social support in the association between social participation and depressive symptoms as well as the moderating role of bonding networks versus bridging networks in this relationship.ResultsFrequent social participation, compared to rare or no participation, was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms, regardless of whether participation included a broad or limited range of activities. Social support only mediated this relationship for those with primarily bonding networks, indicating that the mediation itself was moderated by network type. While participating in both bridging and bonding networks was associated with lower depressive symptoms, bonding networks amplified the effect of social participation on depressive symptoms via increased social support, resulting in an overall twofold decrease in depressive symptoms compared to those with bridging networks.DiscussionThese findings indicate that the frequency of social participation may be a more important consideration for fostering mental well-being in recently resettled refugees than the specific types of activities. Furthermore, while both bonding and bridging social networks confer mental health benefits, access to coethnic networks in early resettlement appears to provide a particularly crucial source of social support."

The results indicate that experts’ decision-making benefits from the chunking process, perception and visual strategies. Despite numerous studies which link these concepts, most of these investigations have employed common research designs that do not use real chess play, but create artificial laboratory conditions via screen-based chess stimuli and obtrusive stationary eye tracking with or without capturing of decision-making or virtual reality settings.MethodsThe present study assessed the visuocognitive performance of chess novices, intermediates and experts in a real chess setting. Instead of check detection, find-the-best-move tasks or to distinguish between regions of a chessboard that were relevant or irrelevant to the best move in previous studies, we introduced n-mate tasks and sequentially manipulated their difficulty. Due to the complexity of the tasks, we monitored players’ visual strategies in a fine-graded initial phase of task-solving and for complete trials, employing non-obtrusive mobile eye tracking, multi-sensor observation and full-automatic annotation of decision-making.ResultsThe results revealed significant expertise-dependent differences in visuocognitive performance based on a circumstantial spatial and temporal analysis. In order to provide more detailed results, for the first time the analyses were performed under the special consideration of different time intervals and spatial scalings. In summary, experts showed a significantly higher number of fixations on areas of interest and empty squares between pieces in the task processing than less-skilled players.

Therefore, it is necessary to examine whether the causal model of the perception of errors, challenge, and deliberate practice will be reproduced in the same way as in non-disabled athletes. Therefore, this study aimed to verify a causal model of the perception of errors, challenges, and deliberate practice by athletes with disabilities.MethodsThe participants were athletes with physical and hearing impairments registered with the Korea Paralympic Committee. Data were collected through a survey and the participants responded using a self-report method. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to verify normality, correlation analysis to examine relationships between variables, and structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses.ResultsBased on SEM analysis, the results of this study showed that the causal relationships between the perception of errors, challenges, and deliberate practice were partially significant. Specifically, perception of errors and reflection positively predicted challenges, whereas burden of mistakes negatively predicted challenges. Additionally, challenges were found to have a positive effect on deliberate practice.DiscussionBy comprehensively examining the above, it can be interpreted as a major factor that can promote and reduce challenges depending on how athletes with disabilities perceive their mistakes."

Data were collected through caregiver-and clinician-reported history at clinical visits to the program. Descriptive frequencies were utilized to describe participant demographics, skills and behaviors, and receipt of services, across age groups in childhood.ResultsDelays were present across all developmental domains; in particular delays in language, communication, and academic skills, and behavioral challenges were commonly reported. Almost all children received Early Intervention services, and many young children received non-public therapies after completing EI. Older participants demonstrated more impairments than younger age groups, yet received services at lower rates, particularly behavioral and speech language interventions.ConclusionA snapshot of developmental skill attainment in individuals with DS is provided. Therapies to support the levels of need were reported at much lower frequencies than the level of need reported to target aspects of development and behavior. Several gaps in therapies and educational services were identified. There is an important need for tailoring supports, based on developmental level, to meet individual needs.

In consideration of the fact that striving to attain a positive identity is fundamental to all human beings, given the role of coaches as societal agents and through identifying that the concept of identity is becoming one of the key themes in HRD, this paper placed attention to identity from a perspective of individual coaches and on behalf of the coaching industry. Subsequently, the aim of this paper was to contribute new insights about the theme of identity in coaching based on findings drawn from empirical research specifically about coaches’ knowledge, awareness and understanding of identity in the process of coaching. The paper also set out to explore coaches’ choice of methodology and tools when coaching on issues of identity and it posed questions related to coach education in relation to the theme of identity. In the absence of theory and past research on identity coaching recognised in the literature review, this qualitative experiential research project was conducted through semi-structured interviews with fourteen experienced executive coaches. This study has highlighted that the nature of executive coaching had the capacity to move towards a whole-person approach enriched by an increasing more explicit introduction of themes brought to coaching which reside at deeper psychological levels and are concerned with people’s identities. Based on the findings, the research put forward recommendations with regards to rethinking what executive coaching is, introducing a more systematic approach of identity coaching, improvement to coach education and future research to create a body of knowledge that will enable the coaching practitioners to be effective at coaching at the level of coachees’ identity."

Despite the extensive literature on caregiver distress, there is a lack of validated measures to provide evidence of psychological distress of caregivers of MM patients. Therefore, in a previous study we developed the Mesothelioma Psychological Distress Tool–Caregivers to evaluate the specific profile of psychological distress in this population. This paper describes the item selection, factor analysis, and psychometric evaluation of the revised MPDT-C.MethodsThe analyses of this work first aimed to confirm the previous factorial structure. In the case of nonfit, it aimed to find an alternative structure and causes of nonfit in the model. Examination of the fit of the factorial model was conducted using a Bayesian approach.ResultsThe final version of the MPDT-C is a -item self-report questionnaire consisting of one factor .ConclusionHaving a short self-report questionnaire to assess the psychological distress experienced by caregivers of MM patients has several advantages. First, it is suited to epidemiological studies where multiple variables and measures are involved. Second, it is easy to administer and does not take much time to complete. Therefore, the MPDT-C can also be administered in clinical contexts, perhaps when MM patients attend follow-up medical evaluation.

Two approaches have been found effective in enhancing conceptual knowledge: self-assessing one’s conceptions and acquiring conditional metaconceptual knowledge about why and in which contexts specific conceptions are appropriate or not. However, it is unclear how these approaches influence other cognitive and affective variables, such as self-efficacy and cognitive load. Nevertheless, it is essential to investigate whether making students aware of their intuitive conceptions affects their self-efficacy and to what extent reflecting on one’s conceptions requires additional cognitive resources. Thus, we conducted an experimental intervention study using a × factorial design with N = upper secondary biology students. Becoming metaconceptually aware of one’s conceptions did not lower students’ self-efficacy but enabled more accurate beliefs about their abilities. However, the self-assessment increased mental load, which partly suppressed the beneficial effect of the self-assessment on conceptual knowledge. In contrast, the instruction on conditional metaconceptual knowledge did not result in higher mental load and, thus, aligned more with students’ cognitive capacities. Furthermore, students with more pronounced general metaconceptual thinking reported lower mental load, implying that regular instruction focusing on metaconceptual thinking may reduce load. Thus, it is suggested to continuously promote students’ metaconceptual thinking and to embed metaconceptual activities repeatedly across longer instructional units."

This study examined the relations of coping strategies and cognitive emotion regulation to academic achievement goals and academic performance among Chinese children . Full Structural Equation Modeling analysis showed that children’s use of active coping strategies was positively associated with their endorsement of performance approach and mastery avoidance goals. Avoidant and support-seeking coping strategies were not associated with any outcome variables. Maladaptive CER was positively associated with performance approach, performance avoidance, and mastery avoidance goals and negatively associated with academic performance; adaptive CER was positively associated with mastery approach goals but not associated with other outcome variables. The current study provided some preliminary evidence to indicate that active coping strategies, maladaptive CER, and adaptive CER were associated with academic achievement goals and academic performance among Chinese children. Although maladaptive CER was not used as often as adaptive CER by Chinese children, the more they used maladaptive CER, the more likely they were to have academic achievement goals that focused on things other than learning itself, whereas the more Chinese children used adaptive CER, the more likely they were to set an achievement goal to master the knowledge. Therefore, in teaching practices or intervention planning, decreasing maladaptive CER strategies may be as important as cultivating adaptive CER strategies to facilitate academic success among Chinese children."

Based on the mentioned research, the aim of the present study is to investigate listening comprehension and its influencing factors specifically in German-Russian simultaneous bilinguals aged – by considering the home- and majority language. The study uses quantitative data collection methods such as linguistic tests in Russian and German for the elicitation in different levels of listening and questionnaires for strategy use and background. The research questions are as follows: What does the language proficiency and input in Russian look like? Regarding listening comprehension in Russian as a home language, are there differences between the speakers within comprehension on different levels, e.g., is sound decoding easier than sentence parsing? If there are differences in Russian as a home language, which linguistic and background variables can correlate with the performance of listening comprehension on its different levels? Concerning the first research question, the results show relevant differences between four different levels of listening comprehension , which strengthened the assumed complexity of listening comprehension in the home language. In addition, the results show different connections between the listening comprehension competence and the input from different family members, as well as exposure to film and television in the home and majority language."

However, recent work has shown that selection of ERS is dependent on, e.g., situational demands and personal resources.MethodsIn this current investigation, we used an online diary to investigate ERS used by free choice and their association with ER-success, stress and rumination. We identified four factors of ERS: cognitive perspective change, cognitive-behavioral problem-solving, suppression-distraction and body-social ERS. Associations of ERS with stress, state-rumination and ER-success were investigated using multilevel-mixed-models, allowing to separate within- and between-subject effects.ResultsOur results show that, on a within-subject level, all adaptive ERS were positively associated with ER-success, while maladaptive ERS as well as higher stress and state rumination were negatively associated with ER-success. On the other hand, only within-subject cognitive ERS were associated with higher self-efficacy. Maladaptive ERS-use was consequently positively associated with stress and state rumination. Surprisingly, only cognitive perspective change ERS were negatively associated with state rumination. Cognitive-behavioral problem-solving was positively associated with stress and success of emotion regulation.DiscussionWe interpret these results in the light of situational constraints of ERS-use and the importance of the assessment of these in future studies."

Our analysis involved a sample of parents who dedicated a minimum of h per week to caring for their children. The parents were invited to complete three validated instruments—the parenting stress index short form , the family resilience assessment scale , and inventory of the child-friendly family —to evaluate their level of parenting stress, family resilience, and child-friendly family, respectively. We tested the mediation model by applying structural equation model analysis. It was found that child-friendly family negatively correlated with parenting stress . This relationship is mediated by family resilience. That is “child-friendly family” leads to increased “family resilience” , which in turn leads to lower “parenting stress” . The mediation effect ratio was .%. We used multiple regression analysis to test the moderation model and found that family resilience did not play a moderating role between child-friendly family and parenting stress. This study holds particular significance for two key reasons: Firstly, it elucidates the relationship between child-friendly family, family resilience, and parenting stress, highlighting the potential of creating a child-friendly family to reduce parenting stress through the enhancement of family resilience.

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is assumed to be a key player in applying cognitive control; however, the neural mechanisms by which this process is accomplished are still unclear.MethodsTo further address this question, an audiovisual Stroop task was used, comprising simultaneously presented pictures and spoken names of actors and politicians. Depending on the task block, participants had to indicate whether they saw the face or heard the name of a politician or an actor . In congruent trials, both stimuli belonged to the same response category ; in incongruent trials, they belonged to different categories. During this task, activity in sensory target regions was measured via functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography , respectively. Specifically, fNIRS was used to monitor activity levels within the auditory cortex, while the EEG-based event-related potential of the N was considered as a marker of FFA involvement. Additionally, we assessed the effects of inhibitory theta-burst stimulation—a specific protocol based on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation —over the right DLPFC. Non-invasive brain stimulation is one of the few means to draw causal conclusions in human neuroscience. In this case, rTMS was used to temporarily inhibit the right DLPFC as a presumed key player in solving Stroop conflicts in one of two measurement sessions; then, effects were examined on behavioral measures as well as neurophysiological signals reflecting task-related activity in the frontal lobes and sensory cortices.ResultsThe results indicate a central role of the DLPFC in the implementation of cognitive control in terms of a suppression of distracting sensory input in both the auditory cortex and visual system in high-conflict situations. Behavioral data confirm a reduced Stroop effect following previous incongruent trials that was only accomplished with an intact DLPFC .DiscussionBecause non-invasive brain stimulation is uniquely suited to causally test neuroscientific hypotheses in humans, these data give important insights into some of the mechanisms by which the DLPFC establishes conflict resolution across different sensory modalities."

A prospective counterbalanced repeated-measures study design was employed. Depressive affect was evaluated using standard psychometric tests of explicit and implicit negative affect. Implicit measures are considered less subject to bias related to social expectations, self-awareness, or willingness to disclose. Other than their usual OCs, participants were medication-free and had been using OCs for a median of mo. We found that measures of implicit affect displayed a more depressive-like pattern of performance during active hormone intake, particularly among a subgroup of OC users who reported experiencing high levels of depressive affect more generally.

Second, they showed the same level of awareness about mental states as controls, but they were significantly weaker in conceptualizing the relationship between mental states and behavior. Also, they found it very difficult to think about possible strategies that they or others might employ to realize desires and needs. Finally, they performed similarly to controls in understanding emotions, while they poorly understood desires and beliefs. These results point out the distinctive characteristics of ToM development in individuals with ASD, with important implications for individualized interventions."

These trends have the potential to diminish the future learning enthusiasm and holistic development of vocational high school students, thus impacting their competitiveness in the future job market.MethodsThis study employs a motivational model for vocational high school students based on self-efficacy theory and person-environment fit theory to explore whether the competitive atmosphere moderates the impact of self-efficacy and competitive attitudes on task motivation. Using a secondary data research approach, the study analyzed a sample of Taiwanese vocational high school students from the Programme for International Student Assessment dataset with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling .ResultsThe results indicate that self-efficacy and competitive attitudes positively influence task motivation. Additionally, self-efficacy not only enhances competitive attitudes but also indirectly influences task motivation through the mediation of competitive attitudes. The study also revealed that the moderating effect of the competitive environment was not statistically significant in the overall sample. Further multiple-group comparisons between male and female vocational high school students showed no significant differences in most paths, but gender differences emerged in the positive moderating effect of the competitive environment on the influence of competitive attitudes on task motivation.ConclusionThese findings suggest that in cultivating task motivation among vocational high school students, interventions should be tailored to accommodate the differing responses of male and female students. For female students, providing more opportunities for teamwork and utilizing collaborative approaches to cope with the competitive environment may enhance task motivation. Conversely, for male students, enhancing self-efficacy and stimulating intrinsic competitive attitudes may be more effective. Addressing these differences could potentially reduce the occurrence of the “lying flat” phenomenon among vocational high school students in the future."

While long-term studies indicated that emotional distress of refugees either stagnates or ameliorates over time, long-term research on refugees’ integration and its’ interaction with emotional distress is limited. The examined long-term predictors for refugees’ emotional distress and integration in this study were, amongst others, severe physical abuse in childhood, residence status and length of stay.MethodsThe sample included refugees, .% male, mean age . years. Trained psychologists screened for emotional distress with the use of the Refugee Health Screener in a semi-structured interview. Integration progress was screened using the Integration Index with the subdimensions psychological, economic, political, social, linguistic and navigational integration. Longitudinal differences for emotional distress and integration sub-dimensions were evaluated by sign tests and t-tests. The longitudinal course of integration was evaluated with a Mixed ANOVA. Further, two hierarchical regression analyses were performed to analyze longitudinal predictors of emotional distress and integration.ResultsOverall, emotional distress decreased, and integration increased over time. In particular, the sub-dimensions of social, economic, and linguistic integration increased significantly over time. Two regression analyses determined significant predictors of emotional distresst : psychotherapy , emotional distresst , and integrationt , and one significant predictor of integrationt : integrationt .ConclusionThis is the first study to longitudinally examine the Integration Index with all subdimensions. Over the course of months refugees’ overall integration, and the sub-dimensions of social, economic, and linguistic integration increased. Whilst the emotional distress of initially highly distressed refugees ameliorated over the course of nine months, their symptom severity remained clinically significant. Results emphasize the importance of early integration for the long-term development of mental health and integration in refugees. Refugees’ emotional distress and integration are intertwined and need to be addressed promptly after refugees’ entry into the host country."

Studies show that the art of living, described as the ability to lead a conscious and reflective life, can be learned and trained. The question arises as to what role the development of “art of living skills” have played in the treatment of depressed patients to date, and to what extent the targeted promotion of art of living within the framework of the therapy of depressed patients has an effect on the well-being and the level of depression that goes beyond this. The study is based on a mixed design. Study participants in the first experimental group each received one session of min psychotherapy per week for weeks. The second experimental group received psychotherapy equivalent to EG with additional life-skills reflection questions, which were to be answered every day and recorded in a diary. The control group received neither therapy nor reflection questions. The art of living, degree of depression, and satisfaction with life were assessed before and after the -week therapy and in the follow-up after months, and the effects were compared. There was a significant decrease in the depression score over the weeks in both therapy groups. EG showed a greater decrease in depression over the weeks. However, the difference did not persist over the months. Furthermore, in EG there was a significant increase in the Art of Living, Satisfaction with life, and Flourishing Scale over the weeks, while in EG there was no change. However, the comparison in the follow-up after months also shows that these effects could not stabilize. Overall, the results provide promising indications for integrating the art of living as a concept more strongly into the therapy of depressive patients.

A microgenetic analysis was conducted on a selected variant pair that demonstrated high adaptive fitness in the niche by employing developmentally advanced cooperative scaffolding tools. The conversational ecosystem phase was characterized by repeated maternal theory-oriented “why” questions and coordinated child causal responses, forming a joint epistemic investigation that facilitated the child’s moral understanding of the characters’ responsibilities and motives. The pair used quasi-justice procedures to gather evidence, judge, and construct moral attributes for the characters.

With the increasing severity of living conditions, misinformation is believed to spread more widely, while corrective behaviors tend to decrease. Furthermore, social comparison also affects the perception of life circumstances and subsequent behaviors. Taking Shanghai’s COVID- lockdown as an example, this study examined whether two representative factors—the duration of the lockdown and the satisfaction with relief measures—affected people’s tendency to share and correct misinformation. By employing the third-person effect theory, the underlying mechanisms of social comparison were also explored.MethodsAn online survey was conducted in April , when the Zero-COVID policy was implemented in Shanghai. In addition to questions about life circumstances, a third-person perception scale, a behaviors of sharing misinformation scale, and a behaviors of correcting misinformation scale were included in the survey. Finally, , valid responses were collected.ResultsIt was found that both behaviors—sharing and correcting misinformation—were affected by life circumstances but in different ways. The evidence also supported the existence of third-person perception . It was observed that the relationship between satisfaction with relief measures and sharing behavior was mediated by Third-Person Perception.ConclusionThis study reveals that the proliferation of misinformation during crises is related to the deterioration of people’s perception of life circumstances.

The approach is based on established theories and constructs but represents them in an intervention- instead of questionnaire-oriented form. Six discriminant and targetable dimensions of behavior determinants are proposed: Consideration, feasibility, instrumental evaluation, norms and goals, affective evaluation, and needs and tension states.MethodsFor estimating the importance of these dimensions for a specific behavior to be changed in a specific situation and population, a quasi-experimental approach is proposed, in which interventions are designed to have effects on one of these dimensions but none on the other dimensions. By measuring changes of the target behavior or its consequences, the impact of each dimension on changing the behavior can be estimated in-situ without questionnaires. The approach was applied to develop a campaign for reducing picnic littering in an urban park in Zurich . In , posters targeting four dimensions were set up during three waves in up to four zones with two control zones without posters. Before, between, and after the intervention waves, for at least weeks, no interventions were in place. The volume of litter was measured on days at points.ResultsIn some cases, the amount of litter was too small for effects to be detected, but where enough littering occurred, posters providing information, inducing positive emotions, or activating reciprocity norms—as well as providing the option of separating fractions of waste for recycling as a structural measure—reduced litter significantly. Interventions targeting the tension state of disgust had no effect. Posters targeting descriptive and injunctive norms increased the amount of litter.DiscussionBased on the results of the preparative study, a large-scale campaign was designed, implemented, and evaluated in , which led to promising effects."

Then we selected newly diagnosed breast cancer patients for a randomised controlled trial. The control group received conventional care , and the observation group received a PERMA-based positive psychological intervention programme. Patient data were collected before and after the intervention, and the dataset consisted of patient responses to general information, the Depression Screening Scale , the Hamilton Depression Inventory , and the Questionnaire on Psychosocial Adjustment in Breast Cancer Patients.ResultsA total of patients completed the study , and before the intervention, there were no statistical differences in the comparison of general information, subthreshold depression scores, and psychosocial adaptation scores between the two groups . After the intervention, the subthreshold depression scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group , and the psychosocial adaptation scores were significantly higher than those of the control group .ConclusionA positive psychological intervention programme using PERMA as a framework was more effective in reducing subthreshold depression levels and promoting levels of psychosocial adjustment in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.Implications for practiceInterventions for subthreshold depression are not limited to the traditional aftercare model, but rather from a positive psychology perspective. Especially for patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, this is a new endeavour that has important implications for them.

While current mindfulness-based interventions are usually rooted in Asian contemplative traditions, mindfulness practices can equally be found in other knowledge systems, including integrative medicine systems such as anthroposophic medicine . The Activity-Based Stress Release program incorporates the latter as part of an -week-long online intervention combining mindfulness exercises, behavioral self-observation, and mindful movement practices derived from this integrative medicine frame. The program could offer additional means for cultivating mindfulness, thereby addressing the necessity for diverse approaches in conjunction with individual differences, diverse clinical demands, or restricted capacities to perform certain mindfulness practices. Using an observational repeated-measures design, the current study aimed to assess a large-scale online implementation of this program in terms of its feasibility, assessing perceived stress and mindfulness.MethodIndividuals who enrolled in any of the ABSR program iterations carried out during and agreed to participate in the study completed online surveys including validated stress and mindfulness scales at the beginning, middle, end, and follow up of the intervention. Linear-mixed models were used for data analysis.ResultsA total of individuals took part in the study, of which .% filled in at least surveys. In line with our expectation, mindfulness scores increased significantly over the course of the intervention, while stress scores decreased significantly in this timeframe. We further found differential effects of self-practice frequency and duration on the outcomes.ConclusionThis study provides a first indication of stress reduction in conjunction with the online implementation of this novel MBI. The work further suggests that this AM-based intervention indeed targets mindfulness, as do other MBIs, and that it is adaptable to an online format.

However, whether there is an intermediary or moderating role among these factors remains unclear. Additionally, while some studies suggest an increased likelihood of unsafe behavior among miners following fatigue, physiological data concerning their cognition remains incomplete and requires further exploration. This study aims to explore the mediating and moderating effects of emotional regulation strategies among miners regarding their personality traits and work fatigue, and to expand understanding of the cognitive and physiological data related to miners’ risk decision-making following fatigue.MethodFifty adult miners were selected as participants. Emotional regulation tendency, significant levels of personality traits based on the Big Five Personality Traits questionnaire, and the three-dimensional levels of work fatigue were measured using emotional regulation strategy scale, Big Five Personality Traits questionnaire, and work fatigue scale, respectively. The eye–brain consistency hypothesis posits that eye movement trajectories and fixation points reflect the brain’s cognitive processes and focus. Therefore, combining eye-tracking experiments, miners’ preferences in risk decision-making were further measured.ResultsExpressive suppression strategies mediated between conscientiousness and depersonalization; expressive suppression strategies moderated between agreeableness and emotional exhaustion. In eye-tracking physiological experiments, significant differences were found in eye movement data among miners with varying levels of emotional exhaustion.ConclusionPreferences in emotional regulation strategies play mediating and moderating roles between miners’ Big Five Personality Traits and work fatigue. The levels and dimensions of work fatigue are influenced not only by personality traits but also by individual tendencies in emotional regulation strategies, which significantly affect performance in risk decision-making. The findings of this study can further enrich theories related to work fatigue among miners and provide insights for personalized safety management in mining."

This research seeks to investigate the causal impact of adjustable lifestyle factors on cognitive deterioration, including frequency of alcohol intake, onset of smoking, and sedentary activities like prolonged television viewing.MethodsThis research combines large-scale genetic data obtained from univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses with experimental findings obtained from animal models.ResultsOur findings reveal that the odds ratio for cognitive function deterioration was . for each standard deviation increase in television watching time. After adjustment for body mass index , number of days walked /moderate activity over + min and education in Multivariable Mendelian Randomization , only the genetic predisposition to increased television watching time remained significantly associated with worse cognitive function . The other two habits had no significant effects. Sensitivity analyses have confirmed that genetic pleiotropy did not influence the results. To further explore the relationship between sedentary behavior and cognitive function, as well as the underlying mechanisms, we conducted a restricted cage housing experiment and a physical exercise training experiment in mice. The results showed that physical exercise significantly improved spatial memory, as assessed by the Morris water maze, and increased exploratory interest, as evaluated by the open field test and the elevated plus-maze test, compared to the sedentary control group. These cognitive advantages may be mediated through mechanisms involving free radical scavenging and enhanced synaptic plasticity.ConclusionOur research provides genetic evidence indicating that extended television viewing is linked to an elevated risk of cognitive decline. Additionally, experimental data from mouse models suggest that physical exercise can counteract cognitive decline and anxiety-like behaviors induced by sedentary behavior. This protective effect is likely mediated by reactive oxygen species -dependent mechanisms that enhance synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus."

For Israeli Jews, feelings of empowerment were linked to satisfaction and positive attitudes, but keeping in touch was unexpectedly linked to acceptance. This unexpected effect maybe because keeping in touch is done mainly through social networks that focus on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, often with a focus on Israel’s transgressions against Palestinians. Consistent with this explanation, Study showed that Israeli Jews viewed accepting messages from Germans as more conciliatory when presented with transgressions against Palestinians, and empowering messages as more effective when presented with reminders of historical victimization by Nazis.DiscussionThe findings from Study partially support the needs-based model of reconciliation and additionally suggest that reconciliation needs vary with context. Implications for people-to-people peace-building interventions are discussed."

This study investigated the OSRL characteristics of K- teachers in China, who embody the dual roles of learners and educators. It also analyzed the differences in OSRL abilities across different genders, education stages, and school locations, and examined the correlation between education qualifications, years of service, and OSRL abilities.MethodsA self-report measure was used to assess K- teachers’ OSRL, with data collected from , K- teachers in northeastern China. Descriptive statistical analysis was utilized to explore the characteristics of their OSRL. Independent t-tests and ANOVA were employed to investigate differences in OSRL among different genders, regions, and educational stages. Correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between education qualifications, years of service, and OSRL among K- teachers.ResultsThe data analysis revealed that K- teachers scored the lowest in Online Learning Self-Efficacy , followed by Online Learning Management Strategies , and then Online Learning Resource Management . Notably, urban K- teachers exhibited higher OLSE abilities than their rural counterparts, while high school teachers scored higher in OLSE and OLMS compared to primary school teachers. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between education qualifications and K- teachers’ OLSE, whereas a negative correlation was identified between years of service and K- teachers’ OLSE.ConclusionThe findings reveal an uneven development across various dimensions of online self-regulated learning among K- teachers, necessitating support for the advancement of OLSE, OLMS, and OLRM. Particular attention should be given to the OLSE of teachers with longer teaching years and rural teachers. Encouraging K- teachers with lower education qualifications to pursue further education is also recommended.

However, no study has examined whether such cognitive benefits were to a similar extent for the young-old, the old–old, and the oldest-old groups. The purpose of this research was to determine whether aging would have an impact on the changes in cognitive function that would occur in older adults with varying degrees of social involvement.MethodsThe sample for this study comprised , older adults who participated in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey during the waves spanning from to . At baseline, participants were classified into the young-old , the old–old , and the oldest-old groups.ResultsThe level of cognitive function decreased as participants aged. Importantly, compared to those lacking social activities, individuals who were got involved in social engagement at baseline had slower rates of cognitive decline over time. Furthermore, compared with the young-old group and the old–old group, the impact of social activity engagement on slowing cognitive decline was more salient for the oldest-old group.ConclusionActive engagement in social activities can slow age-related cognitive decline, particularly for the oldest-old group. To preserve cognitive function with aging, attention and resources should be allocated to encourage social activity engagement."

The wrist was proved to be the most affected body site, followed by the shoulder, finger and arm. Respondents who experienced PRMD reported “pain,” “fatigue,” and “stiffness” as the most frequent symptoms. The main risk factors associated with PRMD included gender, years of playing experiences, practice hours, warm-up habits before practice, and break-taking during practice.DiscussionFemale students, those with longer year of playing experience, those who practice longer hours, those who do not warm up before practice, and those who do not take breaks during practice were found to have more PRMD symptoms and higher level of severity. This study highlights the need to increase awareness of PRMD among conservatoire students and to understand the occurrence of PRMD; it is helpful for young pianists to prevent severe musculoskeletal disorders and implement preventive measures at early career stages. Further studies are suggested to follow up on music students who have had at least one PRMD at different stages of professional musical training."

A conditional process model was proposed and tested with achievement goals as mediators between achievement motives on the one hand and coach-reported performance and self-regulated learning on the other hand. The probability of success was examined as a potential moderator in the motivational process.ResultsAs predicted, motives to achieve success directly influenced planning and reflection/evaluation, whereas the influence of the success motive on regulation of effort was explained partly by task- and self-based approach goals. The motive to achieve success was, however, particularly crucial for maintaining these beneficial regulatory processes when the probability of success was found to be from moderate to low. Concerning the avoidance paths, the data supported only some of our original hypotheses. The motive to avoid failure predicted all three types of avoidance-based and other-based approach goals but did not contribute to explaining planning, reflection/evaluation, regulation of effort, or performance. There were no significant correlations between motivation variables and coach-reported performance.

Families stand to benefit from more positive involvement of fathers with both coparents and children, key contributors to healthy child developmental outcomes. In this report, we introduce a new strategy and rating system for helping practitioners and supervisors assess the nature and quality of coparenting-related dialogues and conversations in the context of couples group interventions.MethodThe system derives from analysis of relationship-enhancement groups, enrolling English-speaking couples and enrolling Spanish-speaking couples, all parents of young children. All groups were co-led by a male-female team explicitly trained to focus on marital and parenting themes and supervised to address couples issues - not coparenting issues explicitly. All co-leaders spoke the native language of group participants. We documented how frequently coparenting events occurred, and how the nature and quality of events varied within and across groups.ResultsOverall, in both English- and Spanish-speaking groups expressly assembled to focus on marital and parenting issues, coparenting events occurred relatively infrequently. At the same time, both mothers and fathers appeared motivated to raise and discuss issues associated with their coparenting, and extended discussions about coparenting issues broached by the parents blossomed in approximately % of all instances. Process-oriented co-leader responses appeared especially helpful in scaffolding prolonged coparenting discussions.DiscussionWe propose that use of the system as a training, supervision and self-assessment tool can help clinicians become more consciously aware of how well their interventions succeed in promoting and scaffolding coparenting conversations during group interactions."

Despite its significant impact, there are few empirical studies on intra-personal barriers. Consequently, a structural equation model was established to examine the relationships between traditional social gender awareness, gender bias, gender stereotypes, and barriers to participation in leisure sports.MethodsIn this study, a total of questionnaires were collected and analyzed using AMOS . software for structural equation modeling. After model testing, the relationships between the variables were examined.ResultsThe results of the statistical analyses indicated that traditional gender awareness could serve as an antecedent variable for barriers to participation in leisure sports, and that gender stereotypes mediated the relationship between traditional gender awareness and barriers to participation in leisure sports. The study also concluded that gender bias could not mediate the relationship between traditional gender awareness and participation barriers in leisure sports, but gender bias and gender stereotypes could act as chain mediators in the process of the influence of traditional gender awareness on barriers to contact leisure sports.DiscussionThis study emphasizes the need for women to break down the traditional social gender awareness, gender bias, gender stereotypes, and other intra-personal barriers when engaging in leisure sport participation. According to this study, the promotion of sustained and healthy development of women’s sport requires the breaking down of traditional social gender awareness education and the creation of more gender-inclusive sports policies and environments. The significance of the study is that by proposing and confirming the internal participation barriers to women’s participation in contact leisure sports, it will lead to the ideological liberation of women’s gender perspectives, so that they can break down the participation barriers to contact leisure sports, participate in sports activities, and enjoy the right to play sports on an equal footing."

One of the main challenges are the quality and correctness of the output of LLMs as well as the overreliance of students on the output without critically reflecting on it. This poses the question of the quality of the output of LLMs in educational tasks and what students and teachers need to consider when using LLMs for creating educational items. In this work, we focus on the quality and characteristics of conceptual items developed using ChatGPT without user-generated improvements.MethodsFor this purpose, we optimized prompts and created conceptual items in kinematics, which is a standard topic in high-school level physics. The items were rated by two independent experts. Those items that received the highest rating were included in a conceptual survey. The dimensions were designed to align with the ones in the most commonly used concept inventory, the Force Concept Inventory . We administered the designed items together with the FCI to first-year university students. The results show that ChatGPT items have a medium difficulty and discriminatory index but they overall exhibit a slightly lower average values as the FCI. Moreover, a confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a three factor model that is closely aligned with a previously suggested expert model.Results and discussionIn this way, after careful prompt engineering, thorough analysis and selection of fully automatically generated items by ChatGPT, we were able to create concept items that had only a slightly lower quality than carefully human-generated concept items. The procedures to create and select such a high-quality set of items that is fully automatically generated require large efforts and point towards cognitive demands of teachers when using LLMs to create items. Moreover, the results demonstrate that human oversight or student interviews are necessary when creating one-dimensional assessments and distractors that are closely aligned with students' difficulties."

Research indicates that alcohol craving is a significant factor leading to the termination of abstinence. The mechanisms underlying the activation of alcohol craving remain not fully understood. The urge to reach for alcohol may be stimulated by emotions, memories, thoughts, or bodily sensations, as well as external factors. It has been postulated that individuals with high levels of interoceptive sensibility tend to exhibit a high degree of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation in the context of alcohol craving. Deficits in identifying and verbalizing emotions, along with an operational thinking style, facilitate alcohol consumption by impeding accurate insight into one’s mental state, thereby hindering the comprehension of bodily states, emotions, and the regulation of self.MethodThis study involved inmates incarcerated in a prison in Poland, awaiting participation in therapy for individuals with substance dependence following psychiatric diagnosis. Four questionnaires were used in the study: multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Sensibility for interoceptive sensibility, Toronto Alexithymia Scale for alexithymia, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale for emotional dysregulation, and the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale for alcohol craving assessment.ResultsThe results of the study are as follows: the study findings indicated that alexithymia and emotional dysregulation significantly mediates the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and alcohol craving. The indirect effect for both factors was found to be significant, similar to the indirect effect observed for alexithymia as an mediator. However, in the case of emotional dysregulation, no significant indirect effect was observed.ConclusionOur study provides insights into the potential contribution of interoceptive sensibility to the heightened risk of alcohol dependence. Specifically, impaired interoceptive sensibility may be associated with the development of alexithymia and emotional dysregulation, potentially rendering individuals more susceptible to alcohol craving. Interoceptive sensibility could serve as a prerequisite for the cultivation of positive emotional processing skills."

Over weeks of training, the intervention groups engaged in four -min training sessions per week, while the control group attended one -min physical education class per week. Assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. EFs, including inhibition control and working memory, were assessed using the Flanker task and Corsi-block tapping task, respectively. Cardiovascular fitness was measured by the multi-stage fitness test.ResultsThe golf group showed significant improvements in inhibition control from pre- to post-intervention , while the football and control groups did not exhibit significant changes. Post-intervention comparisons indicated no significant differences in EF performance between the golf and football groups; however, both outperformed the control group . No significant improvement was observed in working memory for any group.

Based on research findings, this study proposes suggestions for the performance evaluation mechanism of university teachers, including improving the recruitment methods, increasing the emotional labor assessment and incentive mechanism, focusing on alleviating negative emotions of teachers, strengthening the awareness guidance and education of school management and teachers on emotional labor, establishing training courses on emotional labor for teachers, arranging various activities reasonably, and creating a good working atmosphere. Ultimately, these suggestions aim to help university teachers recognize the significance of emotional labor, promote their educational and teaching work, and provide new methods and paths for improving the work performance of university teachers."

Thus far, a few studies have investigated whether father presence influences adolescent daughters’ resilience. Therefore, this study investigated the extent to which intermediary factors affect the relationship between father presence and daughters’ resilience. A total of Chinese female high school students participated in a questionnaire survey. The results showed father presence was positively related to resilience in female high school students. Additionally, psychological security fully mediated the relationship between father presence and daughters’ resilience, whereas achievement goal orientation partially mediated this relationship; specifically, the mastery-approach and performance-approach orientations. The results highlight the importance of considering the meaning and implications of father presence and daughter’s resilience in Chinese culture."

According to many philosophers, however, phenomenal consciousness resists this view. Many famous arguments in Philosophy of Mind have been given to reject this notion. In this paper, we argue that there is something odd about the idea that phenomenal consciousness is a special case in science and give a constructive proposal on how consciousness can fit in the natural world. To do so, we will first introduce a general notion of what grounding is. Then, we will briefly explain how the arguments for the specialness of phenomenal consciousness work by considering two famous examples, namely the zombie and the knowledge argument. In a further step, we will briefly discuss two cases from other areas in science, i.e., in particle physics and chemistry. We will demonstrate that the standard view about the reductive relation does not hold, even in these paradigm cases of the natural sciences. If what we argue is true, we think that most arguments from phenomenal consciousness cannot defeat physicalism per se. Finally, we will introduce an alternative way to naturalize phenomenal consciousness."

This diminished well-being can have far-reaching implications, like impact on career or academic engagement. While there are some studies on specialty choice or academic performance few studies have examined the effects of stress at the beginning of medical school on career ambitions and the associated interest in research. Given the anticipated future shortage of healthcare professionals and the goal of gender equality in higher positions, it is crucial to examine this relationship as early as medical education. The question arises whether medical education and the demands of studying influence the career ambitions of different student groups.MethodAs part of a longitudinal survey, students from a medical cohort are surveyed over three consecutive years. A total of students participated in the surveys, of which .% were women. Stress experiences during medical school and career aspirations are assessed and analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equation modeling.ResultsThe results indicate that early academic stress is a negative predictor of the career ambitions of medical students . Also, female students report lower career goals than male students . In addition, gender moderates the impact of stress on career ambitions . Finally, stress levels are highest when starting the medical program and decrease over time.DiscussionStress during the initial medical training impedes students to pursue higher career ambitions. Future research as well as medical programs need to elaborate more on and consider structural stress prevention interventions in order to promote well-being and strengthen also scientific career goals at an early stage, specifically for female students."

We conducted an event-related brain potential experiment to study the predictive inference revision with increasingly supportive information for the low-competitive predictive inference alternatives. It serves as the very first attempts to study the predictive inference revision mechanisms by combining a larger range of ERP components, including frontal-Post-N-Positivity as an index of revision to examine the influences of the alternative inferences at later stages of reading comprehension.

Consequently, it becomes imperative to identify the most effective conflict resolution practices applicable within this context. To achieve this, a thorough procedure based on mixed methods was employed to analyze and interpret both classroom conflict behaviors and teachers’ strategic responses.MethodThis study employed an indirect observational methodology, from a mixed methods approach. Data was collected through a focus group comprised of teachers. Following the connect framework, the procedure was conducted in three phases: QUAL-QUAN-QUAL. Two analytical techniques were implemented. A lag sequential analysis was used to explore potential behavioral patterns. The results of this analysis informed a polar coordinate analysis, which generated a visual representation of the relationships between codes.Results and discussionA focus group addressed four questions, yielding satisfactory data quality control results . In polar coordinate analysis, the observational instrument categories were designated as focal behaviors. Each of the analyses treated all categories as conditioned behaviors. The analysis identified activation/inhibition relationships between focal and conditioned behaviors. Of these, were statistically highly significant, distributed across quadrants: Quadrant I , Quadrant II , Quadrant III , Quadrant IV . Significant gaps in understanding of conflict were identified, along with disparities in the resources and competencies necessary for successful conflict resolution among the observed educators. Specifically, teachers frequently employed techniques informed by intuition rather than deliberate strategy learned in their training. Consequently, the study advocates for enhancing teachers’ cognitive and emotional competencies to optimize conflict management within the classroom and bolster their adaptive coping mechanisms."

First, we carried out a simulation to estimate the likelihood that stimuli sequences used in past work may not have used balanced proportions of response repetition and switch trials. More specifically, we sought to determine whether the larger distraction effect for response repetitions may have reflected a rarer, and thereby more surprising, occurrence of such trials. To do so, we simulated , stimuli sets for a -AFC task with a proportion of deviant trial of . or .. Second, we carried out a -AFC oddball task in which participants judged the duration of a tone . We carefully controlled the sequence of stimuli to ensure to balance the proportions of response repetitions and response switches across the standard and deviant conditions.

This suggests that the larger distraction found for response repetition in past work may in fact have been underestimated. In the tone duration judgment task, the results showed a large impact of the response type on distraction as measured by response times: Deviants sounds significantly delayed response repetitions but notably accelerated switches.

Therefore, this clinical-experimental study investigated the efficacy of mindfulness and NF on the EPN in oncology patients.MethodThe study enrolled cancer patients . The study design was an RCT with a parallel group [NF versus mindfulness ] waitlist paradigm. EEG recordings in an oddball task with neutral, rare positive and negative valence and high and low arousal stimuli were performed at three measurement time points . Following preprocessing, data from electrodes O, Oz and O were analyzed for EPN amplitudes.ResultsResponse time did not differ across groups and conditions. Comparing EPN at T and T, there was a significant interaction of time, valence, and intervention . Descriptive statistics showed increased EPN for negative stimuli after the NF intervention , while EPN for positive stimuli only slightly increased. For mindfulness, positive stimuli evoked stronger amplitudes after the intervention, while EPN for negative stimuli increased from T to T.ConclusionDistinct effects were observed for the EPN for pictures with negative valence. Here, it is presumed that mindfulness treatment led to a refocusing of attention with a focus on positive valence, whereas NF seems to entail a different processing of images with negative valence and is therefore to be seen more in the sense of a confrontational approach. Our results suggest that both interventions are suitable for modulating EPN. However, it is not clear to what extent the effects are due to the interventions alone and how other factors might have affected the amplitudes, which highlights the need for further research in this area."

While this enhancement has been considered not to result from distractor inhibition, no empirical evidence has been provided through behavioral data. In this study, we investigated whether -min interventions of focused attention and open monitoring meditations could reduce distractor inhibition in meditation-naïve participants divided into focused attention meditation, open monitoring meditation, and control groups.MethodsWe employed a task set that combined a cognitive interference task with subsequent preference judgment and surprise recognition tasks, utilizing the mere exposure effect paradigm, along with state and trait questionnaires. The mere exposure effect shows that repeated exposure to face images increases one’s preference for them. However, this effect is reduced if participants consciously or unconsciously try to inhibit the face images during stimulus processing. In the cognitive interference task, they judged the direction of the letter superimposed on a distractor face image. In the subsequent preference judgment task, they were asked to rate the preference of face images, half of which were presented in the interference task and the remaining half were not presented. We hypothesized that inhibiting face images presented as distractors would lead to a decrease in preference for them.Results and discussionsWe found that the mere exposure effect was observed in focused attention meditation and open monitoring meditation groups but not in the control group, indicating that compared to the control, focused attention and open monitoring meditations reduce inhibition processes for distractors during cognitive interference tasks. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the intensity of the mere exposure effect and state relaxation before the cognitive interference task as well as a negative correlation between the intensity of the mere exposure effect and state anxiety in the focused attention meditation group, but not in the open monitoring meditation group. This suggests that the processes of reducing inhibition in focused attention and open monitoring meditations differ. Our findings contribute to understanding the attentional mechanisms underlying mindfulness meditation during cognitive interference."

Words related to pain may hold distinct status because of their relevance to survival. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to investigate semantic influences on cognitive processing. This study aims to determine if words related to physical and social pain elicit stronger aversion than general negative words by assessing the Affective Compatibility Effect in implicit and explicit tasks. In Experiment , participants performed a lexical decision task on positive words and negative words, of which not related to pain, related to physical pain, and related to social pain. Participants held down the central key of a keyboard and released it to press a key far from the screen or close to the screen for words. In Experiment , participants performed a valence evaluation task on the same words. They held down the central key and released it to press a key close to the screen for positive words and a key far from the screen for negative words , or the opposite . In Experiment , we found faster RTs for social pain-related words compared to other categories. We also found faster RTs in the approach condition than in the avoidance condition, regardless of whether valence or semantics were considered as independent variables. In Experiment , we found faster RTs in the congruent condition than in the incongruent condition when semantics was considered as independent variable. We also found an interaction valencecondition, with faster RTs for negative words in the congruent condition than in the incongruent condition when valence was considered as independent variable. Our findings suggest that, notwithstanding pain-related words do not affect aversive behaviors compared to negative, pain-unrelated words, they are processed faster when conveying social pain. This supports the hypothesis that the cognitive system differentiates and responds congruently not only based on general semantic categories, like pain, but also possibly based on nuances within it."

Several previous studies on this topic have found few examples of spillover and have focused primarily on individual influences, indicating the need for a better understanding of the factors that have an impact on whether, how, and when spillover occurs. To this end, a novel conceptualization examining the interactions between identity principles and socio-material elements, the Identity and Practice Interdependence Framework, was applied to investigate the occurrence of spillover of sustainable routines from the workplace to home.MethodsThree focus groups totaling employees of a major Brazilian steel-producing company, interviews in employee homes, and on-site observations of work and private domains provided data that was analyzed qualitatively, using a deductive reflexive thematic approach.ResultsParticipants identified changes in home routines related to sustainability as resulting from their experiences at work. With the consistent availability of practice elements , learning about, witnessing and performing sustainable routines at work favored satisfactory levels of identity principles . Analysis suggested that seeking the same satisfactions of identity principles outside the workplace led individuals to adapt, change, and/or create more environmentally-responsible routines in their homes.DiscussionThe Identity and Practice Interdependence Framework permitted investigation of the integration of socio-material aspects with the role of individuals in the process of spillover, and indicated some ways they may interact. Both the provision of socio-material components in the first setting and the recognition of more sustainable routines as a feasible path to satisfaction of identity principle needs contribute to individual engagement and persistence in the second setting. Consistent and frequent experiences with more sustainable routines in the first setting or situation may be key to creating this expectation, and therefore to the occurrence of spillover to another setting. The framework complements previous approaches by allowing for a more complex analysis of spillover, which can be used to enrich research on sustainable practices and help promote environmentally-friendly behaviors and sustainable routines, or other desired outcomes, both within organizations and beyond."

The complexity of such a judgment arises from the multitude of observations and their different possible explanations. This complexity might be reduced when teachers focus on one hypothesis instead of considering multiple hypotheses, interpret information in a confirmatory way, and not collect diagnostically relevant information. However, in this way, they run the risk of undesirable biased judgments. It therefore seems important to improve diagnostic judgments by selecting and processing information in a more reflective way. Research indicates that if information on a student is not easily available but restricted , a teacher who wants to make a careful decision is forced to rely on more reflective processes in the selection of tasks and in the interpretation of solutions. The present experimental study therefore investigates how the restricted availability of information in a specific diagnostic situation—when diagnostically inexperienced prospective mathematics teachers determine misconceptions in decimal fractions—influences the underlying cognitive processes. We assume that restricting the availability of information on student behavior augments the attentional focus and therefore reduces cognitive biases. Such more reflective processing can be observed by an increased time spent per piece of information, which should lead to the processing of relevant information and further increase judgment accuracy. To investigate these hypotheses, prospective teachers without prior knowledge in diagnosing misconceptions were asked to diagnose misconceptions on decimal fractions of virtual students by collecting information on students’ solutions. Data concerning the effects of restricting the availability of information on teachers’ cognitive processes were analyzed. The results show that with restricted information, participants indeed select a greater proportion of diagnostically relevant tasks, which positively influences judgment accuracy. These results are discussed with respect to their significance for framing teacher training and for further research."

Becoming a mother increased the tension between dependence and independence in the context of disability, which also influenced the intersection of their motherhood and disability identities and their wellbeing. Practitioners should provide emotional support to mothers with disabilities and help them embrace the positive aspects of each identity and strike a balance between them."

We compared the results of the KSPD with those of a pre-pandemic developmental research and compared the developmental age of KIDS with children’s chronological age . Moreover, the same developmental research was conducted again on the same children at – months of age. DA for receptive language and expressive language was lower in the KIDS compared to CA in the investigation at – months. However, in the investigation at – months, there were no areas where KIDS’ DA was lower than CA, and DA in the areas of manipulation, receptive language, social relationship with adults, discipline, and eating was higher than CA. On the other hand, using the KSPD, there were no differences when compared to pre-pandemic data in the investigation at – months. Furthermore, the investigation at – months showed that developmental quotient was lower in the Language-Social areas than in the investigation at – months. The lower DQ of L-S in this study was also evident in comparison to the – months pre-pandemic data. These results suggested that to investigate the medium- and long-term effects of the COVID- pandemic on children’s development, it is necessary to use not only parent-filled questionnaires but also individualized developmental scales.

Patients remain at risk of further progression following recurrence, but fear of cancer progression at this time is not commonly examined. Importantly, these fears are known to reach levels in which there are consequences for QoL.MethodsThis study sought to explore levels of FOP, health-related QoL, anxiety, and depression in patients after a recurrence of their cancer in a longitudinal manner. With the study taking place throughout the COVID- pandemic, an assessment of fears related to cancer and the pandemic was included. A sequential mixed method approach was employed for complementarity and expansion purposes. A questionnaire was administered to participants on three different occasions one month apart. A sub-sample of participants then took part in semi-structured interviews.FindingsFOP was present at moderate levels in patients with a cancer recurrence, with over a third of the sample reaching levels considered dysfunctional. Levels of fear were stable over three months and were not predicted by select demographic or clinical factors. On average, depression was low, but anxiety reached mild levels. Challenges to health-related QoL were evident. Low levels of concern about COVID- in relation to cancer were reported. Integrated findings provided more nuanced answers to the research questions, including more specific worries about cancer progression.ImplicationsFindings support the development of psychosocial interventions to manage FOP, and future recommendations are provided. Identifying the presence of fears not commonly screened for after cancer recurrence adds to the existing knowledge in this area. Through acknowledging and attending to the psychosocial impact of FOP, healthcare professionals can provide tailored support to enhance the well-being of those with a recurrence of their cancer."

A general data questionnaire, exercise self-efficacy scale, perceived social support scale, and ActiGraph GTX accelerometer were used to investigate. The structural equation model was used to analyze the mediating effect of exercise self-efficacy between perceived social support and sedentary behavior.ResultsThe mean sedentary behavior time in stroke patients in this study was min, the mean score of perceived social support was , and the mean score of exercise self-efficacy was . The correlation analysis revealed that, the sedentary behavior of stroke patients was negatively correlated with exercise self-efficacy and perceived social support. The results of the mediation analysis showed that exercise self-efficacy played a partial mediating role between perceived social support and sedentary behavior.ConclusionPerceived social support and exercise self-efficacy were influential factors in sedentary behavior. Moreover, the impact of perceived social support on sedentary behavior was partially mediated by exercise self-efficacy. Therefore, to decrease the sedentary behavior, it is crucial to improve the level of perceived social support in stroke patients. Patients with less perceived social support can improve their exercise self-efficacy and thus perceive more social support."

Respondents were asked what they envied about the opposite sex, and qualitative analysis was performed on their answers. A total of distinct categories of envy were identified.ResultsThe analysis revealed significant differences between men and women in the nature of their envy. Women expressed envy towards men in domains linked to biological conditions and social advantages, such as salary, prestige, physical strength, and the absence of menstruation, childbirth, and menopause. Men, on the other hand, envied women for their physical attractiveness, ease of seduction, ability to perform traditionally female tasks, and motherhood.

They often show skill application on content knowledge from another, “exemplifying” domain . Although learners’ focus should remain on the skill, learners need to understand the content knowledge to benefit from worked examples. Previous studies relied on exemplifying domains that are familiar and contain simple topics, to keep learners’ focus on skill acquisition.AimWe examined whether using a relevant exemplifying domain would allow learners to acquire both skills and content knowledge simultaneously, or whether relevant content distracts from the main learning goal of skill acquisition.Methods and resultsIn a training study with psychology students, we used example-based learning materials with an exemplifying domain that was either relevant or irrelevant for participants’ course outcomes. We assessed cognitive load, declarative knowledge about skills and course-related content knowledge, and argumentation quality. Incorporating relevant content knowledge in worked examples did not reduce learning outcomes compared to a condition using an irrelevant exemplifying domain.DiscussionContrary to previous research, the results suggest that worked examples with a relevant exemplifying domain could possibly be an efficient teaching method for fostering skills and content knowledge simultaneously."

Sanda principally involves striking the opponent to secure victory, with trauma frequently occurring to the head; however, it remains unclear whether prolonged training enhances or impairs the athletes' attentional capacities. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Sanda training on athletes' attention by employing attention network tests.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on professional Sanda athletes from a certain sports academy; college students from the same institution majoring in physical education were recruited as the control group. Control participants had no prior experience in Sanda training, and the Sanda and control groups were matched in terms of sex, age, and education level. The Attention Network Test was administered to both groups to compare differences in efficiency across the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks.ResultsCompared to the control group, the Sanda athletes exhibited significantly higher executive control network efficiency values and executive control network efficiency ratios . There were no significant differences between the Sanda group and the control group regarding the efficiency values of the alerting and orienting networks . Additionally, total accuracy and total reaction time between the Sanda athletes and control participants showed no statistically significant differences .ConclusionSanda practice has detrimental effects on attention, including a decrease in the efficiency of the executive control network and a prolongation of the total reaction time. Therefore, athletes should improve attention training and use head protection to prevent frequent head impacts during training."

Beyond scientific realism and radical social constructivism, Haraway understands ‘nature’ or ‘world’ neither as a passive resource nor as a human product of imagination. Rather, she argues, the world is to be understood as a ‘witty agent’ that has its own efficacy and historicity in the production of knowledge. Instead of epistemic reification, possession, and appropriation of ‘nature’, knowledge production should be understood as a conversation between material-semiotic actors, human, and non-human, from which none of the actors leaves as they entered. In this study, I want to explore what it means to conceive of nature or world in knowledge processes as a “witty agent” and how exactly one is to imagine this form of non-human agency. To this end, I will first explain Haraway’s re-vision of “nature” beyond scientific realism and radical social constructivism . From this, I will discuss her underlying conception of agency . This involves first, a reconception of the traditional relation between epistemic subject and object as dynamic and situational relation . Second, Haraway characterizes the world’s epistemic agency in more positive terms by using the ‘trickster’ figure as it appears in Southwest Native American representations in the form of a Coyote . Finally, I will come back to Haraway’s initial question of an objective scientific approach to the world, which for her consists in a power-charged social relation of conversations with the world.

To better understand how visuospatial working memory and learning from animation are related, a within-subjects study was conducted. Eighty six students learned from two animations of different complexity. The students’ performance on visual learning tasks, visual and spatial working memory capacity, and perceived task load were assessed. Hierarchical regression analyses show that visuospatial working memory capacity is more critical for learning from a complex animation than for learning from a less complex animation. Moreover, visuospatial working memory capacity predicts learning from a complex animation significantly better than subjective task load. The effect size is large. The results provide a coherent picture of the relationships between learning task demands, learners’ visuospatial working memory, perceived task load and learning performance.

Research on help-seeking youths indicates comorbid symptoms of depression, anxiety, and social deterioration, but less is known about non-help-seeking individuals who may not use healthcare services, possibly skewing comorbidity profiles. Also, findings suggest that adolescents manifesting psychotic symptoms refrain from pursuing help. This gap underscores the necessity of studying non-help-seeking adolescents to better understand their needs and the risks they face without intervention.MethodsWe analyzed responses from adolescents who completed the -year questionnaire in MoBa , identifying those as at risk by their high scores on psychosis-risk items, within the top .% . Comparative analyses were conducted against matched controls to assess differences in psychological and social functioning .ResultsResults indicated that the at-risk adolescents experience significantly more depression and anxiety and have lower self-esteem and poorer social functioning than controls. Social functioning parameters, including leisure activities, social competence, quality of parental relationship, and sense of school belonging, were significantly worse than those observed in controls. The results indicate a pronounced vulnerability among non-help-seeking adolescents at-risk, similar to issues seen in help-seeking youths.ConclusionThese findings highlight the importance of early identification and intervention strategies that reach beyond traditional clinical settings, suggesting the efficacy of population or community-based screenings to prevent long-term adverse outcomes. The study proposes a broader understanding of psychosis risk, stressing the importance of inclusive approaches to support at-risk adolescents effectively."

This study investigates the gender differences in smoking stigma recognized by Korean smokers and explores the effect of these differences on the success of smoking cessation messages that aim to initiate an identity crisis among smokers. It aims to contribute to effective smoking cessation intervention strategies for female smokers.MethodsThe smoker-gender Implicit Association Test was used to measure gender-based smoking stigma; the test comprised photos of people smoking, with positive and negative descriptors. Participants were smokers aged – years . Participants’ cognitive attitudes toward smoking and cessation intentions were assessed at baseline. To investigate the effect of social stigmatization on smokers, participants were asked to watch anti-smoking campaigns that stigmatized either smoking behavior or smokers’ self-identity. Cognitive attitudes and cessations intention were used to show differences in gender and message conditions.ResultsThe IAT D-score showed that female smokers perceived other female smokers significantly more negatively than they did male smokers, suggesting a higher level of smoking stigma. Female smokers in the socially stigmatizing condition reduced their negativity toward smoking less than those who were not stigmatized. Moreover, cessation intentions did not improve when female smokers received identity-threatening messages, indicating that female smokers tended to resist stigmatizing messages.DiscussionsThese findings provide empirical evidence that the gender of Korean smokers is significantly related to differences in smoking stigma. The negative perception and resistance responses of female smokers shown in this study are consistent with the findings of previous studies on the stigma of substance use disorders and addiction. High smoking stigma can also be a risk factor in anti-smoking interventions, including health communication; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution."

Specifically, we investigated the cognitive connectome of adult chess players.MethodWe included chess players and controls with ages between and years. Univariate analysis and graph theory included cognitive measures representing multiple cognitive domains and subdomains. Graph analysis included global and nodal measures of integration, segregation, and centrality. We also performed an analysis of community structures to gain an additional understanding of the cognitive architecture of chess players.ResultsThe analysis of global graph measures showed that chess players had a higher local efficiency than controls at the cost of a lower global efficiency, which did not permeate segregation aspects of their connectome. The nodal graph measures showed that executive/attention/processing speed and visuoconstructive nodes had a central role in the connectome of chess players. The analysis of communities showed that chess players had a slightly reorganized cognitive architecture into three modules. These graph theory findings were in the context of better cognitive performance in chess players than controls in visuospatial abilities.ConclusionWe conclude that the cognitive architecture of chess players is slightly reorganized into functionally and anatomically coherent modules reflecting a distinction between visual, verbal, and executive/attention/processing speed-related functions, perhaps reminiscent of right hemisphere and left hemisphere subnetworks orchestrated by the frontal lobe and its white matter connections."

Intuitively, women are expected to experience greater happiness from the concept of gender equality, while men may see diminished benefits as gender oppression fades away. However, in China, the data indicates a surprising trend: men seem to derive more happiness from gender equality than women. This phenomenon often occurs in countries where gender equality has been achieved, known as the gender equality paradox, while it is relatively rare in countries in transition. In response to this contradiction, a mixed-methods research approach was adopted, utilizing cross-sectional data from the Chinese General Social Survey and conducting interviews with participants. In the context of China, happiness increases with gender-egalitarian attitudes, with men experiencing a more pronounced boost.

In Study , we developed a scale based on Attention Restoration Theory to measure the restorative characteristics of office environments, consisting of three subscales: Being Away, Fascination, and Extent. In Study , we used this scale to examine the correlation between the restorative characteristics of offices and the visual properties of office photographs. The results showed that the square root of the percentage of green area, the color fractal dimension, and the brightness fractal predicted perceived restorativeness. Notably, the color fractal dimension often showed a stronger effect than the amount of greenery per se. These findings suggest that both the presence of greenery and the overall complexity of color transitions in office spaces contribute to their restorative potential. Our study provides insights for designing more restorative office environments, emphasizing the importance of not only increasing greenery but also mimicking natural color patterns. The predictive model developed provides a practical tool for estimating the restorative potential of office designs. Although there are limitations such as the use of photographic assessments and the inability to fully explain the Extent component of restorativeness, this study contributes to our understanding of how to create more psychologically supportive work environments."

Burnout in athletes can have detrimental effects on their performance and careers. The potential mechanisms by which fear of failure and self-handicapping explain the association between maladaptive perfectionism and athlete burnout remain understudied. This study examined their mediating role in the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and athlete burnout.MethodsA total of athletes were chosen to participate in a cross-sectional survey study. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS and AMOS structural equation modeling. The participants filled out self-report assessments on maladaptive perfectionism, fear of failure, self-handicapping, and athlete burnout.ResultsAnalyses indicated that maladaptive perfectionism positively predicts fear of failure, self-handicapping, and athlete burnout. Fear of failure positively predicts self-handicapping and athlete burnout, while self-handicapping also predicts athlete burnout. In addition to the direct pathway, we identified three mediating pathways through mediation analyses: an independent mediation of fear of failure an independent mediation of self-handicapping a chained mediation of both.DiscussionThe results of this study provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms between maladaptive perfectionism and athletes burnout by considering fear of failure and self-handicapping as mediating variable factors. It is shown that the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and athlete burnout can be partially explained through the mediating role of individuals’ fear of failure as well as self-handicapping behaviors. These insights offer a valuable foundation for the design of psychological interventions to address athlete burnout, enabling coaches and sport psychologists to develop more effective coping strategies for enhancing athletes’ psychological well-being and performance."

Accordingly, computer-supported collaborative learning can be beneficial in distance education contexts to overcome the issues specific to online learning . Distance universities often attract a substantial number of non-traditional students . Despite their representation, non-traditional students face negative stereotypes and associated social consequences, including social identity threat, diminished sense of belonging, and less motivation for social interactions. In the context of online learning, where there is little individuating information, social categories like socio-demographic group memberships become salient, activating stereotypes. Consequently, socio-demographic group memberships can have detrimental consequences for the integration of non-traditional students. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent of social identity threat for students in higher distance education, explore the social consequences of this threat in the same context, validate these findings through longitudinal analyses embedded in a CSCL task, and use learning analytics to test behavioral outcomes. In a longitudinal study with three measurement occasions over weeks , we conducted path analyses for cross-sectional associations and Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models for longitudinal predictions. The results showed that non-traditional students mostly reported higher social identity threat than traditional students. While the expected longitudinal within-person effects could not be demonstrated, we found stable between-person effects: students who reported higher levels of social identity threat also reported lower sense of belonging and lower social approach motivation. Exploratory analyses of actual online collaboration during CSCL offer potential avenues for future research. We conclude that social identity threat and its social consequences play an important role in higher distance education and should therefore be considered for successful CSCL."

High pain catastrophizing is an independent risk factor for disability, pain severity, inadequate treatment response, chronicity, and opioid misuse. Interdisciplinary pain programs are beneficial and cost-effective for individuals with chronic pain, but their functional impact on individuals with high pain catastrophizing is not well established. The emerging field of placebo studies suggests that patient-provider relationships, positive treatment expectations, and sociobiologically informed care trigger physiological responses that may enhance therapeutic interventions.MethodsIn this retrospective observational cohort study, we compared admission and discharge data for adults with high-impact chronic pain who completed the Spaulding-Medford Functional Restoration Program . The interdisciplinary FRP team of physiatrists, behavioral health clinicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists specializes in evidenced-based conventional rehabilitation, integrative health, and pain psychoeducation via enriched therapeutic encounters, fostering collaboration, validation, trust, self-efficacy, and positive expectations. Clinical outcome measures included the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure assessing functional performance and satisfaction with function , the Pain Numeric Rating Scale , the Pain Catastrophizing Scale , and the Patient Health Questionnaire- .ResultsFRP participants with clinically elevated catastrophizing at baseline achieved statistically significant improvements in function , satisfaction with function , pain , mood , and catastrophizing . Subgroup analysis revealed racial disparities in pain scores, and exploratory analysis showed a trend toward reducing opiate consumption.DiscussionDespite the known association of adverse outcomes with high catastrophizing, FRP participation was associated with increased productive engagement, reduced pain, reduced maladaptive thought processes, and improved mood. Although causation and efficacy cannot be established from a retrospective design, this is the first study to identify functional improvement in patients with high-impact chronic pain and clinically relevant high pain catastrophizing who participate in an IPP combining conventional and complementary rehabilitation with psychoeducation. These enriched therapeutic encounters may enhance the treatment process by promoting trust, empathy, collaboration, and beneficial reframing of patients’ experiences, expectations, and goals."

The intervention sought to enhance adolescents’ knowledge about nutrition, foster self-regulation skills, and ultimately improve their overall health, including their body mass index . Through a multi-component approach that combined theoretical learning with practical activities and the integration of digital tools such as the MyFitnessPal app, the study targeted improvements in food literacy, which encompasses nutrition knowledge, food label interpretation skills, and cooking abilities. These elements are critical in influencing adolescents’ food choices and eating behaviors, with a focus on increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables while reducing the intake of fast food and processed snacks. The intervention was structured around a series of educational workshops and interactive sessions, facilitated by professionals experienced in nutrition. These sessions covered topics such as food composition, the importance of a balanced diet, and strategies for avoiding excessive consumption of processed and high-energy-density foods. A distinctive feature of the program was its use of digital tools to enhance engagement and allow for the practical application of learned concepts through food tracking and activity monitoring. Preliminary results indicate positive outcomes in terms of increased food knowledge and improved dietary habits among participants. Notably, there was a significant improvement in adolescents’ BMI, highlighting the potential of food literacy interventions to contribute to better physical health outcomes. The study underscores the importance of adopting multidisciplinary and technology-enhanced approaches in educational programs aimed at promoting healthy eating among adolescents. The study’s findings suggest that well-structured food education programs, tailored to address the specific needs of adolescents, can facilitate positive changes in eating behavior. This highlights the critical role of food literacy in adolescents’ health and wellbeing and points to the need for continued investment in research and development to optimize intervention strategies.

Prior studies have revealed evidence of MR in infants, including a sex difference similar to that detected in older populations. Some of these studies used visual habituation methods whereby infants were familiarized with an object rotating through a ° angle, followed by test trials showing either the habituation object or a mirror image object rotating through the previously unseen ° angle. Significantly longer looking at either of these objects was taken to reflect infants’ ability to recognize the habituation object even when seen from a novel viewpoint, suggesting the capacity for MR. However, these infants’ responses could, in theory, be explained with reference to perceptual discrimination rather than MR, because the views of the habituation and test objects were very similar in some video frames. In the current study, we observed a diverse population of -month-olds for evidence of MR through ° of arc. In this more challenging test, our stimuli left a ° gap angle between critical video frames representing the habituation and test objects. Consistent with earlier reports, we found that relative to female infants, male infants looked significantly longer at the mirror image test stimulus immediately following habituation. These results add to an emerging consensus that some young infants are capable of MR, and that male and female infants on average behave differently in this type of MR task."

Despite accumulating evidence that facial expressions and gaze direction interactively influence face processing, it remains unclear how these facial features affect the spatiotemporal processing of looming faces. We examined whether facial expressions and gaze direction interact on the judgments of TTC and IPD for looming faces, based on the shared signal hypothesis that fear signals the existence of threats in the environment when coupled with averted gaze. Experiment demonstrated that TTC estimates were reduced for fearful faces compared to neutral ones only when the concomitant gaze was averted. In Experiment , the emotion-gaze interaction was not observed in the IPD regulation, which is arguably sensitive to affective responses to faces. The results suggest that fearful-averted faces modulate the cognitive extrapolation process of looming motion by communicating environmental threats rather than by altering subjective fear or perceived emotional intensity of faces. The TTC-specific effect may reflect an enhanced defensive response to unseen threats implied by looming fearful-averted faces. Our findings provide insight into how the visual system processes facial features to ensure bodily safety and comfortable interpersonal communication in dynamic environments."

In this study, we explore how various intrinsic variables, including personality, proficiency, gender and age affect the gestures of Cantonese speakers of English as a second language. Participants were asked to narrate a video cartoon. Their proficiency and the frequency of gestures produced was based on those narrations. A functional categorization of gestures was followed, dividing them into semantic and discursive, and that also noted adaptors and micro-gestures, referred to as “flutters.” Personality was self-reported using the question Big-Five inventory. Correlations and a series of generalized linear models were developed to explore the interplay between variables. Agreeableness was found to be positively correlated with semantic gestures; and neuroticism and age were negatively correlated with flutter duration. Contrary to the findings from previous studies, no significant relationships were found between neuroticism and adaptors or semantic gestures, nor between extraversion or openness and semantic gestures. Proficiency and gender had little effect on gestures. As personality has been shown to be an important factor in gesture production in mother tongue speakers, we expected to also see a similar result with foreign language speakers, this not being so suggests that other variables, aside from those tested, should be considered. In particular, the results suggest that emotion and emotional constructs, such as anxiety, self-confidence or empathy, might have a greater impact on gesture production than proficiency or personality, a point which should be taken into account especially in language evaluation contexts or professional contexts with second language speakers."

This study investigated English as a Foreign Language learners’ processing of English binomials and how it is influenced by interlexical factors and intralexical factors . Forty Chinese EFL learners participated in a phrase acceptability judgment task of target binomials and non-binomial controls. Results revealed that learners experienced difficulty judging the formulaicity of binomials. They processed binomial stimuli significantly faster than non-binomial baselines, demonstrating a binomial phrase effect. They also processed L-L congruent items faster and more accurately than incongruent items, showing a robust congruency effect. The congruent items which are lexicalized in the L showed further processing advantage than the non-lexicalized items, indicating a graded congruency effect. Moreover, binomial reversibility and binomial predictability also showed significant effects. These findings highlight the need to distinguish and investigate different types of congruency, explore appropriate measures for MWE predictability, and to examine binomials focusing on their unique features."

In families , living in the Netherlands, parents reported on their parenting practices and their children’s disruptive behavior and negative emotionality. Children’s heart rate reactivity was assessed through a series of stress-inducing tasks. Results from regression-based mediation analyses with bootstrapping showed that negative emotionality and stress reactivity did not mediate the relation between parenting and disruptive behavior.

Additionally, the study will investigate the relationship between these two concepts and their predictive power. The study was conducted using a relational survey model and included university students selected through maximum diversity sampling. The study involved university students from various faculties and grade levels. Data was collected through a personal information form, cognitive flexibility inventory, and critical thinking disposition scale. The data was analyzed using the SPSS program. The results indicate that university students exhibit relatively high levels of cognitive flexibility and critical thinking tendencies. Above the medium level, there was a significant positive relationship between cognitive flexibility and critical thinking tendency. Cognitive flexibility was found to be a significant predictor of critical thinking dispositions, positively and significantly predicting critical thinking disposition and explaining % of it. Individuals with critical thinking tendencies exhibit cognitive flexibility, which is also associated with thinking critically.

The omnipresence of food cues across various settings has been linked to the prevalence of obesity in susceptible populations. However, the influence of the post-prandial state on visual attention to food stimuli remains poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate how a hour fast affects visual attention to food and non-food stimuli in healthy, non-obese individuals.MethodsVisual attention was assessed by measuring the total duration of visual fixations on stimuli presented on a computer screen, using a screen-based eye tracker . Participants were divided into two groups: those who had fasted for hours and those tested within two hours after consuming breakfast . Additionally, performance on the Food Stroop task and electrodermal activity responses were measured to evaluate attentional interference and physiological arousal, respectively. Salivary samples were also collected to assess levels of alpha-amylase and cortisol.ResultsFasted participants exhibited a progressive decline in visual attention toward food stimuli compared to satiated individuals, reflecting a satiated state. This effect was independent of the palatability of the depicted food items and was not observed with stimuli representing non-food items. The Food Stroop task revealed no differences between fasting and satiated participants, indicating that the presence of food-related stimuli does not differentially impact attentional interference under varying hunger states. Moreover, no significant variations were observed in EDA responses across participant groups and stimulus types, suggesting that the modulation of visual attention to food cues by hunger is independent of physiological arousal. Interestingly, satiated subjects exhibited higher levels of salivary alpha-amylase, which was inversely related to their subjective hunger ratings. No differences in salivary cortisol levels were found between groups.DiscussionThe findings indicate a novel influence of mild hunger on the processing of visual food cues, independent of physiological arousal. The decline in visual attention to food stimuli in fasted individuals suggests that satiety modulates visual processing. The lack of differences in attentional interference and physiological arousal between fasting and satiated states further supports the notion that visual attention to food cues is primarily driven by hunger-related mechanisms rather than stress. Additionally, the inverse relationship between salivary alpha-amylase levels and hunger ratings implies that alpha-amylase may serve as a marker of satiety rather than stress."

The present research employed EEG technology and manipulated the color display of reference pictures on beverage bottles to explore the underlying neurocognitive pathways. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the influence of color-flavor association strength on the visual processing of such stimuli as well as the in-depth neural mechanisms. The behavioral results revealed that stimuli with strong association strength triggered the fastest response and the highest accuracy, compared with the stimuli with weak association strength and the achromatic ones. The EEG findings further substantiated that the chromatic stimuli evoked a more pronounced N component than achromatic ones, and the stimuli with strong association strength elicited larger P and smaller N amplitudes than the ones with weak association strength. Additionally, the source localization using sLORETA showed significant activations in the inferior temporal gyrus. In conclusion, our research suggests that color expectations would guide visual search process and trigger faster responses to congruent visual stimuli, both the initial perceptual representation and subsequent semantic representation play pivotal roles in effective visual search for the targets, and the color-flavor association strength potentially exerts an impact on visual processing by modulating memory accessibility."

These scripts are knowledge structures that reside in an individual’s memory and consist of play, scene, scriptlet, and role components. In its “internal script configuration principle,” the Script Theory of Guidance suggests that as learners work in a CSCL environment, these components are dynamically configured, and that this configuration is influenced by the goals of the individual learner. However, this principle has not yet been tested empirically.MethodsIn this study, upon entering a CSCL environment, we therefore experimentally manipulated the goals that students pursued while learning. In one condition, we induced learning goals while in the other condition, no goals were induced. A total of pre-service teachers collaborated in dyads on the task to analyze an authentic, problematic classroom situation by aid of educational evidence. We measured their internal scripts both at pre-test and post-test , focusing on the scriptlet level.ResultsResults show that goal induction had no effects on the kinds of scriptlets participants selected during collaboration. However, results from Epistemic Network Analysis show that learning goal induction led to significantly different combinations of scriptlets than no goal induction. Furthermore, participants from the learning goal induction acquired significantly more knowledge about educational theories and evidence than students from the control condition.ConclusionThis study is among the first to provide direct evidence for the internal script configuration principle and demonstrates the effectiveness of inducing learning goals as a scaffold to support students’ knowledge acquisition processes in CSCL."

In the present study, participants were given either fair or unfair treatment in the first round of a dictator game. They then allocated monetary resources among partners positioned at various hierarchical levels in the second round. Our main goal was to determine if the severity of inequity inflicted on new partners was influenced by their hierarchical status. The results revealed an inclination among participants to act more generously towards partners of higher ranking despite prior instances of unfair treatment, whereas a tendency for harsher treatment was directed towards those with lower ranking. The interaction between the fairness in the first round and the hierarchical status of the partner in the second round was significant, indicating that the effect of previous fairness on decision-making differed depending on the ranking of the new partners.

Nevertheless, as government regulations become more stringent, there is substantial debate over whether environmental regulatory policies can consistently encourage listed companies to increase green environmental investments. Simultaneously, independent board supervision plays a crucial role in promoting the compliance and sustainability of listed companies regarding environmental protection. This paper selected a sample of Chinese listed companies from to , and used a fixed effects model to examine the impact of environmental regulation on the environmental investment of listed companies in China. Moreover, we used a mediation effect model to analyze the role of independent director supervision in influencing the relationship between environmental regulation and companies’ green environmental investment. Additionally, we discuss the heterogeneous impact of environmental regulations on corporate environmental investments. Our findings are as follows: first, during the sample period, the tightening of environmental regulations significantly reduces the growth of environmental investment among the studied firms. As government environmental regulatory policies gradually intensify, the negative impact on environmental investments by listed companies becomes increasingly evident. Second, independent directors help alleviate the adverse impacts of environmental regulations on the environmental investment levels of listed companies. This suggests that the inclusion of independent directors in board governance plays a role in assessing government environmental regulatory policies and overseeing corporate decisions related to environmental investment. Lastly, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that environmental regulation significantly negatively impacts the environmental investment of listed companies in pollution-intensive industries and those located in the western regions. Furthermore, environmental regulatory policies impose greater constraints on the environmental investments of small-sized listed companies compared to their large-sized counterparts."

After the collaboration, group members rated, individually, the intensity of different problems during collaboration, reported which strategies they used to overcome their biggest problem, and rated the success of their problem regulation, their satisfaction with their collaboration, as well as their learning gain. In addition, they answered a knowledge test.ResultsWe found that most students rated technical issues as their biggest problem. Multilevel modeling showed that homogeneous problem perception moderated by problem intensity—contrary to immediate and intensive strategy use—predicted successful problem regulation and satisfaction with the collaboration but not knowledge gain. Case analyses illustrate the assumed mechanism that a homogeneous problem perception facilitates socially shared regulation.ConclusionWe conclude that even in only slightly structured learning contexts, students might only need to jointly identify their problems, whereas the best possible regulation of these problems seems less relevant.

Psychological theories that picture humans as informavores who are averse to ambiguity suggest men would do a DNA test, as does evolutionary theory, which considers investing in raising a rival’s offspring a mistake. We conducted two representative studies using computer-based face-to-face interviews in Germany and Spain to investigate whether men actually want to know and how women would react to this desire. As a base line, Germans estimated that % of fathers mistakenly believe that they are the biological father of their child. Nevertheless, in both countries, only % of fathers reported that they had performed a DNA paternity test, while % said they had not. In contrast, among men without children, % of Germans stated they would do a DNA test if they had children, mostly without telling their partners.

Levels of spontaneous and deliberate mind wandering were measured using intermittent thought probes. Performance was indexed with MRT response time variability and omission errors. Each block started with instructions to mind wander either , , , or % of the time. Analysis was primarily conducted using linear mixed effects models. We found that mind wandering , response time variability, and omission errors increased progressively with instructions to mind wander more and that these instruction-related changes were larger for deliberate than spontaneous mind wandering . This pattern held regardless of whether participants’ eyes were open or shut . Relative to a control group receiving no commands to mind wander, instructing people to mind wander or % of the time led to more deliberate mind wandering, and strikingly, asking people to mind wander % of the time led to less spontaneous mind wandering . Our results suggest that individuals can titrate mind wandering experiences to roughly match instructed levels indicating that mind wandering can be manipulated through simple instructions. However, other features of the data suggest that such titration is effortful and may come with a cost to performance."

But it is far from clear whether and how social support decreases the LH in cancer patients. The purpose of present study is to detect the association between social support and LH and the role of individual resilience and self-efficacy in mediating this relationship.MethodsThe convenience sampling method was utilized. From August to February , a total of lung cancer patients from five tertiary hospitals in one municipalities , and two provinces were recruited, among which were males and were females. LH, social support, individual resilience, and self-efficacy were assessed by using standard scales. A structural equation model was constructed employing AMOS . to examine the interrelationships among social support, individual resilience, self-efficacy, and LH of lung cancer patients.ResultsA total of lung cancer patients were finally included. Social support, individual resilience, and self-efficacy were positively related to LH . The mediation model revealed that the direct effect of social support on LH was significant . Besides, social support could also affect LH through three pathways: the mediating effect of individual resilience ; the mediating effect of self-efficacy ; the chain mediating effect of individual resilience and self-efficacy .ConclusionThe results indicate that social support alleviates lung cancer patients’ LH, and that individual resilience and self-efficacy mediate the correlation between social support and LH. Besides providing adequate social support, intervention strategies built on individual resilience and self-efficacy should be applied to reduce LH in lung cancer patients."

The extent of PS changes in relation to several factors, including emotional states, type of relationship or psychopathology. Attachment anxiety has an impact on the social adaptability of peripersonal space and anxiety and fear are associated with an expansion of peripersonal space, possibly serving as a mechanism of self-protection. Peripersonal space appears to be intricately linked to various psychiatric conditions like anxiety disorders and converging evidence suggests that social maladjustment may predict or exacerbate eating disorder symptoms expression.MethodsFifty-eight healthy adolescents performed a comfort distance estimation task to assess peripersonal space. The Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile was used to assess sensory profiles and the SAFA protocol to investigate psychopathological aspects. Data was analysed using Network Analysis, estimating a Gaussian Graphical Models with a Bayesian approach.ResultsWe found that the task related to comfort estimation distance demonstrated a correlation with the visual scale of the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile .

A total of active police officers with Special Weapons and Tactics training participated in our controlled study. Officers independently took part in one VR training session lasting – min involving an avatar in crisis portrayed by an actor. Officers wore integrated cardiovascular and electrodermal activity measurement devices for physiological monitoring. VR user experience aspects such as induced symptoms or game mechanics were investigated upon completing the training, aiming to evaluate the officer’s perceptions of the technology. We used the DePICT™ scale to evaluate the de-escalation skills of officers, coded by a research professional. Our findings revealed significant differences in heart rate and heart rate variability responses between baseline and VR scenario immersion, suggesting heightened stress regulation during the MHCR simulation using full-body VR. Arousal measurements also revealed measurable responses during the training in VR. Additionally, the user experience assessment indicated a positive reception to the VR training, with minimal VR-induced symptoms. A “Defensive-Dynamics-Dichotomy” was revealed highlighting dominant autonomic responses linked to defensive actions and their respective implications for stress management and cognitive function. A unique constellation of de-escalation skills was revealed among officers who relied on weapons relative to those who did not, to resolve the scenario.

Experiencing affordances perceptually positions us to act in specific ways. The main aim of this study was to argue that this view has explanatory advantages over alternative views. An increasingly popular view within the philosophy of perception, most famously defended by Susanna Siegel, claims that we sometimes visually experience natural and artificial objects as belonging to categorical high-level kinds. When visually experiencing a lemon, one does not only experience its low-level properties such as shape and color, sometimes one also experiences the object as a lemon. A challenge arises when attempting to explain what happens when one experiences an object that is experientially indistinguishable from another object, yet these objects belong to different high-level categorical kinds. For instance, if someone perceptually experiences a lemon as a lemon, her experience can be considered as accurately representing or presenting a lemon. However, if the subject perceptually experiences a lemon-shaped soap bar, which cannot be discriminated from a real lemon by sight alone, the experience is deemed inaccurate because there is no real lemon present. The problem is that such a judgment seems counterintuitive; unlike with hallucinations and illusions, there seems to be nothing wrong with how the object appears. Therefore, it is difficult to understand how the mistake could be a perceptual mistake. I will first present arguments supporting the claim that when we visually encounter objects such as lemons, we sometimes also perceive the affordances of these objects—what they provide or offer us. I will further argue that this perspective on affordances offers a more compelling explanation than other alternative accounts when it comes to our perception of visually indistinguishable objects that nonetheless belong to categorically distinct high-level kinds."

Functional accounts of emotion regulation suggest that the attainment of challenging goals may be supported by regulating emotions which promote utilitarian over hedonic outcomes. When pursuing the challenging, long-term goal of acquiring expert musical skills and knowledge, musicians may wish to prioritise whichever emotions are most conducive to attaining this goal, even if those emotions are not necessarily positive.MethodsVia an online questionnaire, musicians answered questions concerning their musical experience and their expertise-related practice goals. They also reported how strongly they experienced different emotions during practice, and how strongly they desired to either increase or decrease the intensity of those same emotions. Data were analysed using inferential frequentist statistics and Bayesian mixed effects models. Evidence ratios &gt; were considered strong evidence in favour of an effect.ResultsOur analysis showed that musicians experienced and desired strong levels of positive emotions in their practice. In addition, they reported greater desire to intensify positive compared to negative emotions [paired t = ., p &lt; .]. Our Bayesian mixed effects model provided strong evidence that greater desire to intensify anger increased the probability that an observation derived from a musician with stronger expertise-related goals [Est = .; Odds &gt; ,]. In addition to anger, higher levels of expertise-related goals were increasingly predicted by less strong desire to intensify guilt and gloom and greater desire to reduce downheartedness .DiscussionOverall, musicians had a strong, general desire to intensify positive emotions during their musical practice. However, musicians with higher levels of expertise-related goals increasingly indicated a nuanced approach regarding how they desired to regulate certain negative emotions. Findings suggest that musicians engage in selective and sophisticated emotion regulation behaviour that aligns with their long-term commitment to develop musical expertise. They may prioritise emotions which may be functionally beneficial, whilst avoiding emotions which may be counterproductive or undermine efforts. Findings from this study contribute to our understanding of expertise-related, domain-specific emotion regulation behaviour and may inform the design of prioritised musical practice strategies."

Self-directed learning ability is a fundamental skill for students, vital for enhancing academic performance and professional development, and is integral to the continuous learning process of nursing students. Recognizing the relationship between psychological capital and self-directed learning ability is crucial for the progress and development of undergraduate nursing students.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the correlation between psychological capital and self-directed learning ability in undergraduate nursing students, as well as to explore the factors that influence these variables.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted with full-time undergraduate nursing students from a nursing school in Taizhou, China. Psychological capital and self-directed learning ability were assessed using the Psychological Capital Questionnaire and Self-Directed Learning Scale, respectively. Correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses were then carried out to evaluate the relationship between psychological capital and self-directed learning ability among the participants.ResultsThe study revealed that the psychological capital score averaged at . ± ., while the self-directed learning scale score averaged at . ± .. Variations in psychological capital scores were noted based on factors including grade level, being an only child, growth environment, monthly living expenses, parental education level, voluntary selection of nursing major, and club experience. Similarly, differences in self-directed learning scores were associated with factors such as grade level, gender, parental education level, and voluntary selection of nursing major. Moreover, a positive correlation was identified between the overall psychological capital scores and the total self-directed learning ability scores among nursing students. Notably, the multiple regression analysis highlighted that optimism and resilience played significant roles as predictors of self-directed learning ability.ConclusionPsychological capital is positively correlated with the self-directed learning ability of nursing students, with optimism and resilience identified as crucial predictors. Nursing educators can utilize strategies rooted in positive psychology and perseverance to improve the self-directed learning ability of nursing students."

Differences in the Hamilton Depression Scale , Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment , Egma Minn av. Bardndosnauppforstran , and Self-Compassion Scale of participants were compared. A binary logistic model was established to measure the odds ratios of these variables on the occurrence of NSSI. In the NSSI adolescent sample, separate binary logistic models were created with NSSI impulse inhibition, NSSI resistance activity, and NSSI recovery motivation as dependent variables and with parenting styles, attachment to parents, and self-compassion as independent variables.ResultsCompared with adolescents with no NSSI behavior, those who had engaged in NSSI within the past year had higher scores on the HAMD, as well as higher EMBU-negative father parental behavior , EMBU-negative mother parental behavior , and SCS negative self-compassion scores. Moreover, adolescents with NSSI had lower EMBU-father emotional warmth, EMBU-mother emotional warmth, IPPA-attachment to father, IPPA-attachment to mother, and SCS positive self-compassion scores. Current depressive symptoms and maternal punishment are risk factors for NSSI in adolescents, while positive self-compassion was a protective factor. Positive self-compassion can positively predict NSSI impulse inhibition, NSSI resistance activity, and NSSI recovery motivation.

As technology advances, the statistical averaging of large datasets has become a critical component of these analyses. However, recent studies have highlighted discrepancies between statistical predictions and observable realities, especially in high-stress environments like port approach procedures conducted by marine pilots. This study analyzed physiological responses recorded during simulation exercises involving experienced marine pilots. The focus was not on the specific outcomes of the simulations but on the potential faults arising from conventional statistical signal processing, particularly mean-centered approaches. A large dataset of signals was generated, including one signal with a dominant characteristic intentionally designed to introduce imbalance, mimicking the uneven distribution of real-world data. Initial analysis suggested that the average physiological response of the pilots followed an S-shaped curve, indicative of a psycho-physiological reaction to stress. However, further post hoc analysis revealed that this pattern was primarily influenced by a single participant’s data. This finding raises concerns about the generalizability of the S-curve as a typical stress response in maritime pilots. The results underscore the limitations of relying solely on conventional statistical methods, such as mean-centered approaches, in interpreting complex datasets. The study calls into question the validity of standardizing data interpretations based on dominant characteristic curves, particularly in environments as intricate as maritime navigation. The research highlights the need for a re-evaluation of these methods to ensure more reliable and nuanced conclusions in maritime studies. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on data interpretation in maritime research, emphasizing the critical need to re-assess conventional statistical signal processing techniques. By recognizing the potential pitfalls in data generalization, the study advocates for more robust analytical approaches to better capture the complexities of real-world maritime challenges."

The purpose of this study was to examine client perceptions of being coached by a simulated AI coach, who was embodied as a conversational vocal live-motion avatar, compared to client perceptions of partnering with a human coach. The mixed methods randomized controlled trial explored if and how client ratings of working alliance and the coaching process aligned between the two coach types in an alternative treatments design. Both treatment groups identified a personal goal to pursue and had one -minute session guided by the CLEAR coaching model. Quantitative data were captured through surveys and qualitative input was captured through open-ended survey questions and debrief interviews. To sidestep the rapid obsolescence of technology, the study was engineered using the Wizard of Oz approach to facilitate an advanced AI coaching experience, with participants unknowingly interacting with expert human coaches. The aim was to glean insights into client reactions to a future, fully autonomous AI with the capabilities of a human coach. The results showed that participants built similar moderately high levels of working alliance with both coach types, with no significant difference between treatments.Qualitative themes indicated the client's connection with their coach existed within the context of the study wherein the coach was a guide who used a variety of techniques to support the client to plan towards their goal.

We describe how the three axes can be simultaneously relevant, taken into account, and dynamically shifted by the participants in a specific sequence of action. The three axes are not always equally aligned or disaligned, but instead divergent: some are aligned at the same time when others are disaligned. Through a case study with two data excerpts, we show how the divergence is an interlocutors' resource to overcome handle the disalignment of some of the stances, and to eventually achieve sufficient alignment in order to be able to proceed their activity.

During pauses between the animations, students were asked to generate a written summary, to create a drawing, or to do both, whereas a control group viewed the lesson without any generative learning activities. Students were tested immediately or after a one-week delay .ResultsIn both experiments, students who produced written summaries scored significantly higher on the posttest than those who engaged in no generative learning activities , but there was no significant difference on the posttest for students who generated drawings compared to those who engaged in no generative learning activities. In addition, those who engaged in drawing and summarizing did not have significantly different posttest performance than those engaged in summarizing alone.DiscussionWe conclude that writing summaries during a highly visual animated lesson is effective for learning, possibly because it encourages students to engage in generative processing during learning more than drawing and we discuss potential reasons for this in the discussion.

This study deepens the understanding by investigating how learning vigor mediates the mindfulness and procrastination relationship, and how harsh parenting influences this mediation.MethodsThis study, adopting a positivist research approach, utilized a cross-sectional design. Data were collected from students at three middle schools in Henan Province, China, through cluster random sampling. This approach yielded questionnaires. The participants sequentially completed four questionnaires: the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student, the Aitken Procrastination Inventory, and the Harsh Parenting Questionnaire. After removing invalid questionnaires due to incomplete responses and patterned answers, a total of valid questionnaires were obtained, with .% girls and an average age of . years , leading to an effectiveness rate of .%. Upon data collection, SPSS . software was used for correlation analysis, mediation analysis, and moderated mediation analysis to assess the relationships between variables.Results Mindfulness negatively predicts academic procrastination; Learning vigor serves as a mediator in the relationship between mindfulness and academic procrastination; and Harsh parenting moderates the relationship between mindfulness and learning vigor. Specifically, the positive impact of mindfulness on learning vigor is more pronounced in individuals experiencing lower levels of harsh parenting compared to those with higher levels.ConclusionThis study reveals that mindfulness significantly protects against academic procrastination in adolescents, with .% of this effect mediated by increased learning vigor. Additionally, it shows that high levels of harsh parenting weaken mindfulness’s positive impact on learning vigor, tempering its overall protective influence on procrastination. These insights, which apply Trait Activation Theory to educational psychology, not only deepen our understanding of the dynamics between mindfulness and procrastination but also have important implications for addressing academic procrastination in Chinese adolescents."

Public speaking self-efficacy, on the other hand, pertains to learners’ confidence in aspects including the topic, language use, organization, and delivery during public speaking engagements. The path analysis demonstrated that co-planning was a significant predictor of students’ self-efficacy in terms of the topic and organization. Moreover, the co-monitoring strategy exhibited direct and positive correlations with language and topic self-efficacy. Similarly, the co-evaluation strategy showed direct and positive relationships with language, delivery, and organization self-efficacy. Furthermore, both effort regulation and help-seeking strategies were found to have direct and positive impacts on organization self-efficacy.

This research hypothesized that trust forms the basis of an ontology that could unify the social science domains. The proposed ontology comprises a Cartesian plane with axes self-trust and other-trust. Self-trust manifests in dominant behaviors, and other-trust manifests in cooperative behaviors. Both axes are divided into five discrete categories, creating a matrix of cells. All words in the lexicon are allocated into one of these cells.MethodsThis research started with an existing ,-word lexicon of dominance and affiliation. The lexicon was extended by manually identifying and including socially descriptive words with information regarding self-trust, other-trust, dominance, and cooperation. The taxonomy was optimized using the Gradient Descent machine learning algorithm and commercially curated synonyms and antonyms. The t-test was employed as the objective function for Gradient Descent optimization. Word vectors were identified using groups of four words related as synonyms and antonyms.ResultsOver , words were identified and included in the lexicon. The optimization process yielded a t-score of over ,. Over , vectors were identified, such as malevolent-mean-gentle-benevolent. A new form of symmetry was identified between adjectives and verbs with a common root; for example, the words reject and rejected are horizontally reflected.DiscussionThe word vectors can create a metrologically compliant basis for psychometric testing.

However, limited research has explored the relationship between parental control and adolescents’ future planning, neglecting the distinctions between parental psychological and behavioral control, as well as the significant roles of personal growth initiative and meaning in life. The present study aims to investigate the differential effects of parental psychological control and behavioral control on the future planning of rural adolescents in China.MethodsA sample of individuals completed a self-report questionnaire anonymously. The study utilized the Adolescent Future Orientation Questionnaire, Parental Control Questionnaire, Adolescents’ Personal Growth Initiative Scale, and Meaning in Life Questionnaire.ResultsThe findings revealed that parental control significantly influenced the future planning of Chinese rural adolescents, with psychological control and behavioral control exerting distinct impacts in this process. Specifically, parental psychological control was found to have a direct negative effect on adolescents’ future planning, while also exhibiting a positive influence due to the masking effect of meaning in life; it did not negatively affect adolescents’ future planning through their personal growth initiative. On the other hand, parental behavioral control was observed to directly and positively impact adolescents’ future planning, as well as positively influence it through the mediating role of personal growth initiative and the chain mediating role of personal growth initiative and meaning in life.DiscussionThese results suggest that the influence of parental control on adolescents’ future planning is not a simple, singular mechanism, but rather a multi-layered and complex process, yielding mixed outcomes as a result of psychological control, behavioral control, and other factors.

The results showed that the participants experienced constructed objectifications, which included gendered, racial, and sexual objectification. The findings also revealed that participants’ race, gender, and sexual orientation were contextualized based on the situation. Further, participants devalued their Asianness, womanhood, and LGBTQness owing to the lack of positive representation in the curriculum. The analyzed data can be best categorized as the lack of intersectional representations in curricula, contextualized race, gender, and sexuality, and reported experiences of constructed objectifications.

The survey, conducted from October to December , involved , Spanish individuals aged –.ResultsOur results indicated an improved general knowledge of mental health, reduced stigma, and greater acceptance of those affected by these disorders, compared to past research. Almost % of the participants have accurate knowledge regarding the complex and multifactorial nature of mental illnesses. Around % of the participants share the belief that stigma affects those affected by mental disorders. Psychological and pharmacological treatment are considered to be effective and helpful by more than % of the sample. More than % of the participants highlighted that suicide needs to be addressed appropriately in the media.ConclusionThese findings suggest a significant shift in how Spanish society views mental disorders, marking progress over decades of discrimination.

Considering these inconsistent findings, the present study aims to examine a curvilinear relationship between person-job fit and innovative behavior. Innovative behavior represents an individual's actions that come up with, realize, and apply novel ideas within the job environment, and person-job fit, which pertains to the value congruence between the job and individual, can be a critical predictor of innovative behavior. Drawing on the triphasic model of stress and the conservation of resources theory, this study hypothesizes that person-job fit has a non-linear relationship with innovative behavior, and that abusive supervision moderates this relationship. The regression analysis results of the employee-supervisor dyadic data revealed that person-job fit and innovative behavior have a non-linear relationship. Furthermore, the non-linear relationship is weakened when abusive supervision is high and strengthened when abusive supervision is low. By integrating multiple theoretical lenses, the present study offers a more sophisticated understanding of individual employees' psychological reactions to job fit discrepancies and their innovative outcomes in organizational settings. Theoretical and practical implications and directions for future research are also discussed."

These learners often breach the locality constraint of reflexive pronouns, exhibiting a persistent tendency towards optional reflexive comprehension. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the priming technique in altering biases among L learners in anaphora resolution. However, no existing studies have investigated comprehension priming in the context of reflexive interpretation among Chinese EFL learners. This study addresses this gap by conducting a sentence comprehension experiment with high school students to explore the potential of comprehension priming in modifying L learners’ reflexive interpretation biases and examining the persistence of the priming effect. The findings reveal immediate and cumulative priming effects, with no discernible effect observed after week. The results suggest that comprehension priming can occur universally, even without lexical overlap, previously assumed to be a prerequisite. While the priming effect lacks statistical significance after week, there is a numerical increase in participants consistently interpreting the target structure correctly. Thus, comprehension priming emerges as an effective method for L learners to internalize more abstract linguistic rules. Further research on comprehension priming across diverse L populations and language structures is warranted."

This study explores the mechanism through which inpatients’ trust in physicians, self-efficacy, and participation in medical decision-making impact their satisfaction with medical services.MethodsA questionnaire was administered to inpatients in randomly selected tertiary hospitals and randomly selected secondary hospitals in Hangzhou, China. A correlation analysis and hierarchical linear regression were conducted to analyze the factors influencing inpatient satisfaction.ResultsThe outcome measures of trust in physicians and participation in medical decision-making behaviors had significant positive effects on inpatient satisfaction.Trust in physicians was shown to directly influence inpatient satisfaction, while inpatient participation in decision-making partially mediated this relationship. Inpatient participation in medical decision-making fully mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and inpatient satisfaction.ConclusionWhile inpatients were relatively satisfied, there is room for improvement. Healthcare providers should improve patient trust by actively listening to their needs and providing feedback, establishing effective communication mechanisms. Patient self-efficacy can be enhanced through health education, special lectures, and case sharing. Patients should also be encouraged to actively participate in medical decision-making.Practical implicationsBased on inpatient feedback during a preliminary survey, we refined this study’s questionnaire to enhance its feasibility for future research.

Previous studies using cardiac feedback paradigms demonstrated interoceptive effects on self-perception. However, it remains unclear whether interoceptive information can extend self-attribution to non-bodily objects. This study aimed to elucidate whether cardiac signals can induce self-attribution to non-bodily objects and how interoceptive accuracy modulates this effect. A total of male volunteers participated in an emotion assignment task where they viewed images of palms and spheres flashing in or out of sync with their heartbeat and assigned emotional images to these targets. A heartbeat discrimination task was used to measure the interoceptive accuracy. The results showed no significant effect of synchronisation on emotion assignment for either the target type or the valence of the emotional images. However, participants with high interoceptive accuracy attributed both positive and negative images more to synchronised targets than those with low interoceptive accuracy.

However, little is known about the personal and contextual factors that predict nature connectedness. Testing theory derived from a qualitative interpretative phenomenological analysis study, this research addresses the lacuna in the literature. A structural equation model analysis finds that interoceptive awareness significantly predicts nature connection, that secure attachment to nature significantly explains this relationship, and that these inter-related constructs predict both pro-environmental behavior and wellbeing. This revised model of nature connection indicates important antecedents for the human-nature bond, illuminating in particular that the interpersonal relational processes foundational for close bonding with humans also occur in bonding with nature. Structural equation modeling indicates that emotional awareness is the dimension of interoceptive awareness that most significantly predicts nature connection, suggesting that the more aware a person is of the connection between inner bodily sensations and emotions, the more likely they can bond with nature. Given that interoceptive awareness indicates a coherent relationship with the self, including effective communication between body, mind and feelings, this process is therefore implicated in the capacity for humans to bond with nature. In sum, this present research points to the efficacy of an embodied, secure attachment with nature to help close both the human-nature disconnection chasm, and the environmental value-action gap.

Through extensive questionnaires, we assessed these subdimensions alongside affective job satisfaction and the workers’ identification with their organization.ResultsOur findings reveal a significant, positive correlation between job satisfaction and all PEI subdimensions. Notably, while emotional clarity and emotional repair showed a positive relationship with organizational identity, attention did not. Further analysis highlighted the substantial direct impact of Affective Job Satisfaction on Organizational Identification, with emotional clarity and emotional repair playing critical mediating roles.DiscussionThese insights illuminate the unique function of Perceived Emotional Intelligence as a mediator and enhancer in the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The results underscore the necessity of integrating strategies to cultivate emotional intelligence in the workplace, potentially leading to stronger organizational ties and improved overall worker well-being. By shedding light on these complex psychological mechanisms, our study not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also offers practical guidance for fostering healthier, more productive work environments."

Since the task can be performed individually, in a solo action setting, as well as collaboratively, in a joint action setting, it allows us to investigate how joint performances arise from individual performances, which we investigate in a series of interrelated studies. Here we focused on individual skill acquisition on the ball-and-beam task in the solo action setting, with the goal to characterize the behavioral dynamics that arise from learning to couple perception and action. By moving a beam extremity up and down to manipulate the beam’s inclination angle, the task’s objective was to roll the ball as fast as and accurately as possible between two indicated targets on the beam. Based on research into reciprocal aiming tasks, we hypothesized that the emergent dynamics of the beam’s inclination angle would be constrained by the size of the targets, such that large targets would evoke a continuous beam movement strategy, while small targets would lead to a discrete beam movement strategy. participants individually practiced the task in two separate six-block sessions. Each block consisted of one trial per target-size condition . Overall, the number of target hits increased over trials, due to a larger range of motion of the beam’s inclination angle, a stronger correlation between the ball and beam motion and a smaller variability of the beam motion. Contrary to our expectations, target size did not appreciably affect the shape of the beam movement patterns. Instead, we found stable inter-individual differences in the movement strategies adopted that were uncorrelated with the number of target hits on a trial. We concluded that multiple movement strategies may lead to success on the task, while individual skill acquisition was characterized by the refinement of behavioral dynamics that emerged in an early stage of learning. We speculate that such differences in individual strategies on the task may affect the interpersonal coordination that arises in joint-action performances on the task."

The students recorded their training data in the Strava app , and the data were shared in the online sport community created on the Strava platform. Motivation was evaluated using a questionnaire. The focus was both on intrinsic motivation and extrinsic “ICT” motivation, based on Strava app features and tools.ResultsThe most preferred outdoor aerobic sport activities were running , cycling , and walking . The results provided insight into motivation and performance analysis. Students’ motivation to participate in OASA was mainly in health concerns, such as staying in shape , staying healthy , and psychological concerns, such as having fun , improving state of mind , or relieving stress . In achievement concerns, the motivation was a personal challenge , while competing with others was ranked lowest . The Strava app was a motivating tool for students to record, monitor, and analyze their individual activities and feel “connectedness” to the online sport community. % of students were motivated by the non-competitive character of PE, which gave them a personalized opportunity to train without being compared to others.DiscussionThe OASA management, with the use of blended learning methods and the Strava app, uses a motivational approach to create, support, and maintain students’ healthy habits of physical activity through PE lessons. The need for students to be motivated to exercise can be confirmed in the analysis of the statistical descriptive parameters of running, cycling, and walking. There was a tendency for students to complete only the minimum required distance/time . On the other hand, students enjoyed the training, and % of students confirmed that they would enroll again.

As this can increase health and safety risks, there is a need to study the factors responsible for the increase in cognitive load. Ecological situations inherently lack strong experimental controls; therefore, microworlds that simulate real tasks are the usual alternative to field studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no microworlds that reproduce the main tasks of the squad leader during operations. This article adresses this gap by describing the design and validation of a new microworld: the Simulated Multitasking Environment for the Squad leader . Qualitative research was firstly conducted to highlight several squad leader’s generic tasks that guided the design of the SMES. Psychometric validation of the SMES was then based on two experiments: the first evaluated the microworld’s psychometric qualities when tasks were performed individually; and the second explored concurrent tasks, reflecting real-world complexity. The results showed that the parameters manipulated for each task were relevant for inducing cognitive load, measured using a secondary detection response task and the NASA-TLX questionnaire. The SMES demonstrated satisfactory convergent and content validity in multitasking but not in single-task conditions. Performance in multitasking situations therefore does not seem to depend on task-specific skills, suggesting the existence of an independent factor–multitasking ability. Theoretical and practical implications of the SMES validation are discussed."

While clinical interviews remain the standard phenomenological approach, such exploration of lived experiences may prove challenging for this sensitive topic. As a complementary alternative, the use of naturally-occurring online data is opportune for capturing elaborations on tabooed phenomena.MethodsIn this phenomenological study, we present a thematic analysis on lived experiences of suicidal thoughts as spontaneously reported by non-identified users of a Reddit online board , collecting posts using the search terms “suicidal ideation,” “suicidal thoughts,” and “suicide.” Codes were grouped into descriptive categories summarizing the properties of thoughts, their effects, and their relation to suicide. Then, an interpretative synthesis yielded global themes connecting salient meanings on the experience of suicidal thoughts.ResultsWith a long-term and recurring nature, thoughts of suicide appear in the form of vivid imagery and daydreaming’s, initially bringing relief to adverse feelings but eventually becoming conditioned and all-consuming. Rather than a wonderment, they are experienced as intrusive thoughts by people struggling to make meaning of their occurrence. When conciliating the presence of unwanted thoughts, users express intricate relations to wishing or not to die, as well as varying perceptions of control over actions or fear of suicidal behavior.DiscussionWith an innovative application of big qualitative data into phenomenological analysis, this study contributes to an initial characterization of suicidal thoughts, uncovering findings that are not contemplated into current conceptualizations of suicidality.

Bullying is characterized as a repeated set of malicious actions by an individual or group toward another individual in an imbalanced power dynamic, resulting in physical, psychological, social, or material harm to the victim, with the intention of causing social exclusion. The scientific literature has investigated the factors that influence this type of behavior, environmental factors, such as school location and student age, as well as other factors, such as gender and level of physical fitness, also play an important role. This study examined the correlation between motor self-efficacy and bullying, considering that physical activity acts as a regulator in these cases. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed to assess the normality of the data distribution, and Spearman's Rho test was used to analyze the relationship between each dimension of the EBIPQ and E-AEM scores. The Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the reliability of each instrument. The results indicated a significant inverse correlation between the EBIP-Q and E-AEM in the variables of sex, educational stage and school environment. In conclusion, an inverse correlation was observed between motor self-efficacy and bullying, indicating that higher levels of motor self-efficacy are related to lower levels of bullying victimization. Motor self-efficacy could be used as a tool to reduce bullying situations at school. It would be important for government policies to encourage the practice of physical activity in all areas of life in order to improve motor self-efficacy and end bullying."

In fire safety science, a critical factor to occupant responses to building fires is the pre-movement period, determined by how long it takes an individual to initiate taking protective action with an incipient fire. Key to studying the psychological processes that contribute to the duration of the pre-movement period is presenting human subjects with building fires. One approach used in previous research is to present videos of building fires to individuals via scenarios. The numerical simulations used to model fire dynamics can be used to render videos for these scenarios. However, such simulations have predominantly been used in fire protection engineering to design buildings and are relatively inaccessible to social scientists.MethodThe present study documents a collection of videos, based on numerical simulations, which can be used by researchers to study human behavior in fire. These videos display developing fires in different types of rooms, growing at different rates, different smoke thickness, among other characteristics. As part of a validation study, participants were presented with subsets of the video clips and were asked to rate the perceived risk posed by the simulated fire.Results and discussionWe observed that ratings varied by the intensity and growth rate of the fires, smoke opacity, type of room, and where the viewpoint was located from the fire. These effects aligned with those observed in previous fire science research, providing evidence that the videos could elicit perceived risk using fire simulations. The present research indicates that future studies can utilize the video library of fire simulations to study human perceptions of developing building fires as situational factors are systematically manipulated."

It remains unclear how different processes involved in sentence production are affected by healthy aging. We investigated if and how aging affects lexical encoding and syntactic formulation during sentence production, using auditory lexical priming and eye tracking-while-speaking paradigms and if and how verbal working memory contributes to age-related changes in sentence production.MethodsTwenty older and younger adults described transitive and dative action pictures following auditory lexical primes, by which the relative ease of encoding the agent or theme nouns and the theme and goal nouns was manipulated. The effects of lexical priming on off-line syntactic production and real-time eye fixations to the primed character were measured.ResultsIn offline production, older adults showed comparable priming effects to younger adults, using the syntactic structure that allows earlier mention of the primed lexical item in both transitive and dative sentences. However, older adults showed longer lexical priming effects on eye fixations to the primed character during the early stages of sentence planning. Preliminary analysis indicated that reduced verbal working memory may in part account for longer lexical encoding, particularly for older adults.ConclusionThese findings indicate that syntactic flexibility for formulating different grammatical structures remains largely robust with aging. However, lexical encoding processes are more susceptible to age-related changes, possibly due to changes in verbal working memory."

Survey data, including the patients’ general condition questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Scale , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , and Mental Toughness Scale , were collected and recorded in a database using a two-person input format. Data analysis was performed using SPSS . software.ResultsOut of the patients with early- and middle-stage lung cancer included in this study, had anxiety, resulting in an overall anxiety detection rate of .%. The chi-square test showed that statistically significant differences in religion, marital status, surgical treatment, tobacco use, and alcohol history between the anxious and non-anxious groups . Moreover, statistically significant differences were observed in per capita annual family income, pathological type, VAS score, targeted therapy, treatment stage, and mental toughness level . Other factors were not significantly correlated with anxiety onset. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher per capita family income and completed treatment independently acted as protective factors against anxiety onset in patients with early- and middle-stage lung cancer. Conversely, rare pathological types, increased pain severity, and lower levels of mental toughness were identified as independent risk factors for anxiety onset in these patients.ConclusionAnxiety was prevalent in patients with early- and middle-stage lung cancers. Rare pathological types, increased pain severity, and lower levels of mental toughness were independent risk factors for anxiety. Therefore, clinicians and psychologists should pay more attention to patients with rare types of tumors, actively manage their pain symptoms, and consider implementing mental resilience training to improve patients’ mental toughness."

Many studies focus on singular, often objectively measured, outcomes, without acknowledging the breadth of available measures. This approach can result in crucial subjective information, which can be explored to understand actors’ behaviors and responses, being omitted from research and policy. This study explores objective and subjective wellbeing outcomes, and how they relate, within an environmentally vulnerable context. Wellbeing and environmental services are intrinsically interlinked, therefore, appropriate policy solutions are required to address human needs and pressures on supporting ecosystems.MethodsThis paper uses binary logistic regression modelling, and qualitative participatory rural appraisal methods, to understand the environmental conditions, including climatic hazards and landscape characteristics, associated with households experiencing different objective/subjective wellbeing outcomes within Volta Delta, Ghana.ResultsThe mixed method approach highlights a differing relationship between inland agricultural areas impacted by drought and erosion, and coastal/riverine, peri-urban landscapes exposed to flooding and salinization. Agricultural areas associate with “poor but happy” outcomes, whereas peri-urban landscapes associate with being “non-poor but unhappy.” Drawing on existing literature, and both quantitative and qualitative results, these varying outcomes are hypothesized to be driven by differences in livelihood vulnerability, relative comparisons to others, responses to climatic hazards, and individualistic/collective wellbeing conceptualizations.DiscussionOur study concludes that environmental conditions influence objective and subjective wellbeing through different mechanisms. Sustainable development research should incorporate both objective and subjective measures when implementing and monitoring policy to more comprehensibly capture, and improve, wellbeing in environmentally vulnerable locations."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of aging on picture description tasks using two types of pictures: a standardized picture and a culturally and linguistically modified picture tailored for Korean speakers .MethodTwenty-four young adults and older adults participated in two picture description tasks while their eye movements were recorded. Word-level linguistic variables were used to assess informativeness and productivity of connected speech production. Eye-movement measures were employed to evaluate real-time cognitive processing associated with planning connected speech .Results and conclusionsThe findings revealed age-related declines in linguistic measures, with older adults exhibiting decreased CIUs per minute and smaller counts of nouns and verbs per utterance. Age-related changes in eye movement measures were evident in that older adults displayed longer pre-speech fixation durations. Unlike younger adults, older adults exhibited higher pre-speech fixation counts on the Han River picture compared to the Beach picture, suggesting cognitive challenges in performing the task that requires producing more words and detailed descriptions. These results suggest that aging is associated with reduced informativeness and productivity of connected speech, as well as a decline in cognitive processing efficiency."

However, there is a lack of consensus on how well-being is conceptualized and assessed in V.I. research, if it is defined at all. A shared understanding of what well-being means in the context of adult V.I. is essential to enable comparison of findings across studies and collaboration between support organizations.MethodsThis article reports findings from a series of four online focus groups with adults with V.I. and one with practitioners working in the field of adult V.I. The focus groups explored what participants meant by well-being and which factors impacted their well-being. A total of adults with V.I. and five practitioners took part. A list of all components of well-being, factors that impact well-being, and items in the protective buffer that may mitigate the impact of factors on well-being were extracted from the data.ResultsDespite the noted difficulty in defining well-being and disagreement around the extent to which well-being was universal or individual, a preliminary model of well-being emerged from the focus group discussions. The core of well-being reflects an overall feeling of contentment arising from a positive evaluation of how one is feeling, how one is feeling within oneself, and how one is feeling about one’s life. Factors relating to balance/equilibrium, health, mood, other people, the self, and a sense of security and purpose can positively or negatively impact well-being. This impact may be mitigated by a protective buffer consisting of one’s mood, mindset, ability to cope, resilience, and acceptance. Many items were discussed in multiple roles, e.g., as a component of well-being or factor.ConclusionThis research took a bottom-up approach to explore what well-being means in the context of adult V.I. The role of certain items and the structure of the proposed model of well-being will need to be confirmed in future research with stakeholders across the V.I. sector."

Accordingly, we conducted a repeated-measures laboratory study of college students learning to perform a complex computer task to examine the relative importance of affect variability indices compared to mean levels in explaining variance in off-task attention and task performance before and after changes in task demands . In doing so, we also disentangled valence and arousal aspects of emotion. Relative importance analyses showed mean levels of emotion were the most dominant predictors —negative deactivating emotions for off-task attention and positive activating emotions for performance. However, flux in negative activating and negative deactivating emotions also explained enough variance to be considered important, suggesting that flux has been overlooked in empirical research. Our findings also highlight that future research must account for mean levels when examining relationships between affect variability and outcomes of interest."

This study investigates the impact of exaggerated acoustic properties on facilitating Mandarin tone learning for English speakers. Using synthesized tone stimuli, we systematically manipulated pitch contours through three key modifications: expanding the fundamental frequency , increasing F , and extending the overall duration. Our objectives were to assess the influence of F expansion, higher F, longer duration, and varied syllables on Mandarin tone learning and generalization. Participants engaged in a non-adaptive trial-by-trial tone identification task. Mixed-effects logistic regression modeling was used to analyze accuracy across learning phases, acoustic factors, and tones. Findings reveal improvements in accuracy from training to testing and generalization phases, indicating the effectiveness of perceptual training to tone perception for adult English speakers. Tone emerged as the easiest to perceive, while Tone posed the most challenge, consistent with established hierarchies of tonal acquisition difficulty. Analysis of acoustic factors highlighted tone-specific effects. Expanded F was beneficial for the identification of Tone and Tone but posed challenges for Tone and Tone . Additionally, longer durations also exhibited varied effects across tones, aiding in the identification of Tone and Tone but hindering Tone identification. The higher F was advantageous for Tone but disadvantageous for Tone . Furthermore, the syllable ma facilitated the identification of Tone and Tone but not for Tone and Tone . These findings enhance our understanding of the role of acoustic properties in L tone perception and have implications for the design of effective training programs for second language acquisition."

This paper aims to categorize the functional experiences of NEVs into two types: intelligent experience and eco-friendly experience, using a dual-path model. By analyzing , text data from automotive information and service platforms, the relevant factors influencing consumer satisfaction are explored. The research findings reveal that intelligent experience has a significantly positive impact on consumer satisfaction, whereas eco-friendly experience has a significantly negative impact on consumer satisfaction. This suggests that new energy vehicle companies need technological innovation in infrastructure and range to enhance consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, the research confirms that, when facing the intelligent experience of new energy vehicles, consumers’ “rational” thinking plays a dominant role, and efficacy is an intermediate variable to enhance consumer satisfaction. On the other hand, when facing the eco-friendly experience of new energy vehicles, consumers’ “emotional” thinking predominates, and identity is an intermediate variable to enhance consumer satisfaction. Additionally, the moderating effect of perceived usability is examined. When faced with the intelligent experience of NEVs, consumers with high perceived usability are more likely to generate a sense of efficiency. In the case of the eco-friendly experience of NEVs, consumers with low perceived usability are more likely to experience a sense of identity."

While there is substantial evidence for the predictive value of the quantity-number competencies described by the model, evidence supporting the preventive potential of interventions targeting these QNC is so far largely restricted to short-term effects. Findings regarding their long-term preventive impact, especially in terms of transfer to mathematical school achievement, are still limited. This quasi-experimental study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the long-term transfer effects of an intervention program that is strictly derived from the QNL model of mathematical development [QNL training; in German “Mengen, zählen, Zahlen” ].MethodsWe assessed the quantity-number competencies of first-graders and identified of them as being at risk for mathematical learning difficulties, who were then assigned to three experimental conditions. Sixty one children received sessions of the QNL training, while underwent training in inductive reasoning. Another children served as a control group, receiving no specific intervention.Results and DiscussionMulti-level analyses confirmed both significant short-and long-term effects in the specifically trained quantity–number competencies as well as transfer effects on subsequent mathematical school achievement. In accordance with previous findings, transfer effects of the QNL training on mathematical school achievement were not yet evident immediately after the intervention but turned out to be significant after a delay of months and remained stable even months after training. Effect sizes ranged from d = . to d = ..

Adolescent singers who experience physical, mental and emotional changes along with voice change are particularly prone to the development of MPA. However, adolescence also seems to be an opportune time to instil healthy behaviours in singing students as they are more likely to remember these coping strategies, owing to the release of dopamine and the ‘reminiscence bump’. As this period of a singer’s life is wrought with inevitable anxiety development, the additional aim of the study was to develop a coaching framework which can be used by singing teachers in their practice. Mindset training for adolescents seems crucial to help them continue singing through puberty so they do not drop out of singing lessons or choir during voice change and identity development.MethodsThe study aimed to determine if Acceptance and Commitment coaching could be used with adolescent singers with MPA and to record and analyse rich qualitative data in the form of semi-structured participant interviews and questionnaires.ResultsWhen their perception of MPA symptoms and physiological and psychological arousal before a performance changed, their behaviour and reactions changed accordingly. The change took place over a period of time, which was characterised by discoveries about themselves, confusion in understanding new concepts and letting go of old habits. Interestingly, by the end of the coaching sessions, their preoccupation with pleasing the audience and appearing perfect on stage was replaced by a new-found delight in pursuing values and goals related to their singing. Along with this came the acceptance of themselves and others as individuals with the potential for growth and change and the capacity to learn from mistakes.DiscussionThis study marks the first investigation into the effectiveness of using of ACC as an intervention for MPA in adolescent singers undergoing puberty by a singing teacher. The results are promising and suggest that ACC is an effective MPA intervention for adolescent singers to cope with inevitable development-related anxieties and keep them engaged in the activity of singing during their pubertal years."

A significant direct effect of physical exercise on sense of social fairness was also observed . Physical exercise was a positive predictor of perceived social support , which in turn positively influenced both life satisfaction and sense of social fairness . Additionally, life satisfaction had a positive effect on sense of social fairness . Both perceived social support and life satisfaction significantly mediated the relationship between physical exercise and sense of social fairness through two pathways: physical exercise → perceived social support → sense of social fairness ; and physical exercise → perceived social support → life satisfaction → sense of social fairness .Conclusion Physical exercise enhances both perceived social support and the sense of social fairness among college students, suggesting that it not only directly contributes to an enhanced sense of social fairness but also fosters supportive social relationships.

During health crises, patients must choose between mobilizing their remaining resources to either recover or accepting the disease as inevitable. When patients choose to be proactive in terms of protecting their health, are conscientious, and compliant in the recovery process, a high level of patient activation is achieved. Therefore, we examined whether the patients’ K fitness strategies are predictors for engagement in patient activation-type behavior. In addition, we tested the mediating effect of pain catastrophizing and the moderating effect of romantic satisfaction. We found that people with a medical diagnosis, who were in a romantic relationship, and had high-K fitness were much more likely to be activated patients. Moreover, pain catastrophizing mediated the relationship between high-K fitness strategy and patient activation, while romantic satisfaction moderated this relationship, amplifying its intensity. The findings highlight the importance of identifying patients’ psychological resources to keep them engaged in the health recovery process."

However, there are hardly any studies that examine if the three basic dimensions model could represent a suitable approach to measure instructional quality in physical education. Based on an extended model of the basic dimensions, a measurement model of instructional quality for physical education is presented, which integrates different theoretical approaches from the fields of educational and psychological research as well as different subfields of sports science in order to test the factorial structure of the corresponding measurement model.Methods, students from seventh to ninth grade classes from different German-speaking Swiss cantons participated in the study. The conceptualization of the instrument is based on a hybrid approach that integrates generic and subject-specific characteristics. The simultaneous analysis at the individual and class level using MCFA was supplemented by more complex methodological techniques within the relatively new B-ESEM framework at the individual level.ResultsThe postulated five-factor structure was initially tested using ICM-CFA and showed a good model fit . MCFA revealed a differential factorial structure at both levels of analysis with five factors at the individual level and four factors at the class level . ESEM and B-ESEM outperformed the ICM-CFA and showed an excellent model fit . Inter-factor correlations and factor loadings are largely in line with expectations, indicating arguments for construct validity.DiscussionThe study represents a substantial contribution in linking physical education and the generic research on instructional quality. Overall, strong arguments for the factorial structure of the measurement model were demonstrated. The study can be interpreted as a first step in a multi-step procedure in terms of further validity arguments."

Embracing sustainable practices and reducing the unnecessary consumption of resources is essential in our current times. One can be sustainable by focusing on either buying sustainable or green products or by using fewer resources, i.e., by adopting curtailment behaviour. The purpose of this study is to determine various factors and their impact on the curtailment behaviour of youths.MethodsWe used an exploratory and descriptive research design. Responses were generated from young respondents using a structured questionnaire developed based on the extant literature.ResultsThe structural model findings showed that social norms, eco-concern, and religiosity significantly and positively affect curtailment behaviour. However, we observed no significant influence of financial concern or government policy on curtailment behaviour. We also tested the moderation impact of government policy on the relationship between economic concern and curtailment behaviour. The findings suggest that the relationship between eco-concern and curtailment behaviour is stronger for consumers exhibiting higher commitment to government policy.DiscussionIt is imperative that politicians exercise critical thought and devise strategies to encourage more sustainable consumer behaviour. With the strains that our world is under now and in the future, we need to unite around a common goal: ensuring that our planet is sustainable for coming generations.

However, our understanding of the psychological mechanisms that drive cryptocurrency adoption is limited. This study examines the role of basic human values in three stages of cryptocurrency adoption–awareness, intention to buy, and ownership–using the Theory of Planned Behavior . Logistic regression analysis was conducted on a quota sample of German adults, and the results showed that openness-to-change values increased the likelihood of cryptocurrency awareness, while self-enhancement values increased the likelihood of intention to buy and ownership. These findings were consistent even after controlling for demographic characteristics, attitudinal beliefs, and perceived behavioral control, which are important factors in the TPB.

The Highly Sensitive Person Scale has been utilized to capture the multifaceted experiences of highly sensitive individuals. The scale’s total score is an indicator of high sensitivity. However, it cannot differentiate between the contributions of the specific subfactors. Consequently, interpreting the total score cannot help resolve the current theoretical debate about how individuals integrate the positive and negative aspects of sensitivity, whereas a multidimensional profile should be able to offer a more comprehensive understanding. Intriguingly, in variable-centered research, the subfactors’ differential associations with external constructs in negative or positive trait spaces have suggested heterogeneity among highly sensitive individuals. Thus, person-centered approaches should be better suited to address this heterogeneity.MethodsTo explore heterogeneity within the highly sensitive population, we conducted a three-step Latent Profile Analysis in two independent German-speaking samples . Subsequently, we employed the Five-Factor Model of personality to provide a detailed description of the latent sensitivity groups.ResultsBeyond the frequently identified quantitative three-class differentiation of sensitivity groups, we obtained a four-class model that included two qualitatively different high-sensitivity groups, each displaying distinct HSPS subfactor and personality patterns that corresponded to prototypical personality profiles. Within these high sensitivity groups, the Confident Sensitivity Group exhibited average Neuroticism, significantly above-average Openness, and slightly above-average Extraversion. By contrast, the Vulnerable Sensitivity Group displayed the typical personality pattern of significantly above-average Neuroticism, below-average Extraversion, and slightly above-average Openness. Personality analyses revealed that features such as passiveness, internalizing tendencies, giftedness, and aesthetics, often commonly ascribed to all highly sensitive individuals, are features that differ across distinct sensitivity groups.DiscussionTo avoid over- or underestimating sensitivity effects, future research should consider these interindividual differences in highly sensitive individuals. For instance, studies could focus on the different associations of sensitivity groups with abilities, health aspects, emotion regulation and intervention outcomes, taking into account the different environmental factors that shape the type of sensitivity."

Chinese culture cherishes time deeply, and for centuries there has been a tradition of “educating children and youth to inspect the passage of time.” However, in today’s age of information and intelligence, time has shown a trend toward fragmentation. How do contemporary Chinese college students view the passage of time, and what structures or content does it contain? The answer to this question remains uncertain, necessitating further exploration. Following Flavell’s theory of metacognitive knowledge , we adopted a semi-structured interview method and used the results to first outline the basic structure of Chinese college students’ view of time passing, identifying four major aspects: priming aftereffect, life touching, positive promotion, and negative inhibition. Then, using the initial four-dimensional structure as a starting point, we developed the Metacognitive Knowledge of Time Passing Scale , and carried out exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to test its fit. The results showed that the four-factor scale and its items had a good fit to the data. Third, the reliability and validity of the self-developed scale were tested.

This phenomenon may negatively impact the older adults, a “digitally vulnerable” group, by limiting their access to diverse health information and potentially inducing health information avoidance behaviors. However, the psychological mechanisms within this impact process remain unclear, and this study aims to explore them. Additionally, current study introduces trait mindfulness as a potential intervention tool in reducing health information avoidance behavior among the older adults.MethodsThis study constructs an impact model based on the Stress-Coping Theory and the Stress–Strain-Outcome framework. It identifies health information similarity, relevance, and overload as characteristics of the echo chamber, constituting the Stress part; information fatigue as the Strain; and health information avoidance as the Outcome, with trait mindfulness serving as a moderating factor between Strain and Outcome. A cross-sectional survey of older adults individuals aged and above was conducted, and the collected data were analyzed using SmartPLS and SPSS.ResultsThe study found that health information similarity and overload significantly increased health information fatigue among the older adults, thereby promoting avoidance behavior, but no significant correlation was found between relevance and fatigue. While there was no significant correlation between trait mindfulness and health information fatigue, it effectively moderated the avoidance behavior induced by fatigue.ConclusionCurrent study reveals the impact of the health information echo chamber phenomenon on health information avoidance behavior among the older adults and the moderating role of trait mindfulness. It emphasizes the importance of breaking the health information echo chamber and promoting diverse information dissemination to improve the health information behavior of the older adults. Furthermore, the moderating role of trait mindfulness demonstrates positive intervention potential, providing the older adults with a psychological adjustment mechanism to accept and process health information with a more open attitude, thereby reducing unproductive avoidance behavior."

Using structural equation modeling that controlled for gender and the overlap between outcomes, shame emerged as the strongest mediator linking AISA with all emotional outcomes. Fear of self-compassion also partially mediated the AISA-posttraumatic stress symptom association, self-coldness partially mediated the AISA-general anxiety symptom association, and characterological self-blame fully mediated the AISA-depressive symptom association.ConclusionAvoidance-based processes, ruminative−/worry-based cognitions, and negative self-evaluative cognitions may be distinctly relevant for AISA-related posttraumatic stress, general anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively, after accounting for the overarching mediation through shame. These internalized stigma-related mechanisms may be useful to prioritize in treatment to potentially reduce AISA-related negative emotional outcomes, particularly for AISA survivors with posttraumatic stress, general anxiety, and/or depressive symptoms."

Children's accuracy was compared with adult performance . The study shows that children between and years of age perform less accurately than adults in all conditions. While adults' performance was highly accurate in all conditions , children performed below chance in both demonstrative conditions and above chance in the labeling condition.

To successfully support positive social interactions, the underlying group processes, such as collaborative group engagement, need to be understood in detail, and the important question arises: How can collaborative group engagement be assessed in virtual group learning settings? A promising methodological approach is the observation of students’ non-verbal behavior, for example, in videoconferences. In an exploratory field study, we observed the non-verbal behavior of psychology students in small virtual synchronous learning groups solving a complex problem via videoconferencing. The groups were videorecorded to analyze possible relations between their non-verbal behaviors and to rate the quality of collaborative group engagement . A rating scheme consisting of four QCGE dimensions was applied, and non-verbal behaviors during the task were coded based on related research literature.

The analyses focus on dialectal and accentual variation in their speech, and whether frequency of dialect use is dependent on selected sociocultural factors. We have found that some speakers, especially those scoring high for overall dialect use, also display style-shifting, i.e. they use dialect features from the region more frequently in unscripted speech as opposed to in more formal speech styles elicited through reading tasks or the wordlist reading tasks. This demonstrates that language learners are capable of developing sensitivity towards the vernacular form in an L.

To assess its preliminary efficacy on student mindfulness and wellbeing.MethodsStudents answered online surveys at course completion. Primary outcomes were course ratings, assignment and assessment completion rates, minutes, types of mindfulness practice, changes in trait mindfulness , and self-reported wellbeing outcomes. We ran Chi-square goodness of fit tests and paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to decide if the outcomes differed significantly post-class. We tested the dose-response relation between mindfulness practice time and trait mindfulness and whether the out-of-class practice time was consistent across the weeks with generalized linear mixed-effect models.ResultsAll participants reported finding the course enjoyable and that they would recommend it to their friends. They practiced for an average of min per week in the class and min on their own. The most common out-of-class practices were mindful movements, sitting meditation, and breathing. Per self-reports, the course increased student understanding of specific mindfulness practices and appreciation for their body. It improved wellbeing and trait mindfulness . We found no does-response relation between practice time and trait mindfulness.ConclusionsThis pilot study supports that incorporating mindfulness practice into college-level courses may promote student wellbeing and such approaches warrant further investigation."

Patients undergo a substantial process of emotional transformation following a lung cancer diagnosis, during which subtle changes in brain function and/or structure may occur. As such, the present study aimed to investigate the neuroplastic changes induced by negative emotions in patients with early-stage lung cancer.MethodsThis cross-sectional study recruited patients with early-stage lung cancer and age- and sex-matched healthy control patients. All participants completed the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , and functional magnetic resonance imaging . Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and regional homogeneity were used as the fMRI indices. Correlations between the clinical assessments and ALFF and ReHo values were calculated.ResultsOur analysis revealed no significant differences in HAMD and HAMA scores between patients and control patients . However, significant alterations in ALFF and ReHo were observed in multiple brain regions in patients with early-stage lung cancer compared to healthy controls . Specifically, ALFF values were decreased in the right postcentral gyrus, calcarine, and left middle cingulate, while ReHo values increased in the right angular gyrus and decreased in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, insula, left calcarine, putamen, superior temporal gyrus, middle cingulate, and right Rolandic gyrus. The HAMD score was significantly correlated with the ALFF value in the right postcentral gyrus .ConclusionThis study provides valuable insights into the adaptive responses of the brain following the early diagnosis of lung cancer, revealing potential disturbances in negative emotional processing. Harnessing neuroplasticity may open new avenues for the establishment of personalized treatment strategies and targeted interventions to support the emotional and mental health of patients with lung cancer."

Psychosocial support systems play a crucial role in managing chronic diseases, yet their specific impact on the disease activity of SLE patients remains unclear. This study aims to explore the dynamic relationship between disease activity in SLE patients and various types of psychosocial support systems.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective longitudinal observational study, including SLE patients who received treatment at our hospital from January to January . Emotional support, tangible support, social interaction support, and informational support were assessed using the revised Social Support Rating Scale. Disease activity was quantified using the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement. The relationship between psychosocial support and disease activity was analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression models, with Bootstrap resampling employed to test the robustness of the results.ResultsWe found a significant negative correlation between psychosocial support and SLE disease activity, with emotional support, social interaction support, and informational support showing stronger negative correlations. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the inhibitory effects of emotional support, social interaction support, and informational support on disease activity increased over time. Although the impact of tangible support was not statistically significant, it gradually became more apparent over time.ConclusionOur findings indicate a significant negative correlation between psychosocial support and SLE disease activity, particularly with emotional support, social interaction support, and informational support. Over time, the impact of tangible support also becomes evident. These findings provide important references for the comprehensive treatment and management of SLE patients.

Saliva was assayed for immunoglobulin A, testosterone and cortisol , and body fat was measured using a skinfold caliper. Self-reports of poor health, and lifestyle factors that could influence health status were collected.ResultsResults showed that symptoms of poor health and skinfold negatively predicted facial attractiveness. There was a modest but statistically non-significant T x C interaction where higher T lower C men trended toward having more attractive faces. A sequential mediation model examining the influence of lifestyle showed support for an indirect effect on facial attractiveness.

In Experiment , participants performed the go/no-go task and conscious investment was manipulated by directing conscious attention either to the finger movement or to the resulting motion of the key . The results showed that neither the participants’ inclination for conscious movement investment, nor the direction of conscious attention affected inhibition performance. In Experiment , participants performed the stop-signal task, which is more attention demanding than the go/no-go task.

Aggression can be assessed both explicitly and implicitly, taking into account the dual processing model. The purpose of the research was to examine explicit and indirect, latency-based measure of aggression in competitive athletes practicing striking combat sports, according to gender and sports performance. At the same time, we verified whether aggression predicts sports performance in martial artists.Materials and methodsA total of athletes practicing striking combat sports took part in the research. For implicit, latency-based measure of aggression, an Implicit Associations Test was used, while explicit aggression was assessed with the Romanian adaptation of the Makarowski’s Aggression Questionnaire for martial arts athletes.ResultsData analysis revealed that athletes from striking combat sports having international sports performances registered significantly higher D-scores and lower values for Go-ahead factor , compared to athletes without outstanding results. Goodman and Kruskal tau association test was used to check the existing associations between athletes’ gender and martial arts athletes’ level of explicit and implicit aggression. In addition, binomial logistic regression procedures were performed, predicting martial artists’ likelihood to obtain higher sports results, based on explicit and indirect aggression.ConclusionA stronger association between Aggression and Others and a moderate level for Go-ahead factor of explicit aggression are associated with an increased likelihood of sports performances in athletes. In addition, male martial arts athletes are more persistent despite obstacles, remaining more on the offensive .

This makes these subjects special and similar. It is therefore of interest to examine the motivation for choosing music and sport as subjects for university study.MethodsIn the present investigation, students at the beginning of their university studies were examined. Among these were music university students in the Bachelor of Music and music teacher education program, and sport university students in the Bachelor of Science and sport teacher education program. The study contained a custom-made questionnaire on sociodemographic data, questions on study choice alternatives and biographical musical or sporting background, as well as two standardized questionnaires on motivation for enrollment and on aspects that are important for the profession.ResultsMusic and sport students were at a rather high and similar level of intrinsic motivation to study their subjects. However, materialistic goals motivated the teacher education students more than the bachelor’s students with an artistic program. The difference between the study programs was also found in the context of extrinsic-social motivation, where the teacher training students answered with higher scores. With regard to socially-induced motivation, it was shown that music students and sport teacher education students were more socially induced to study the respective subject compared to the general student population. With regard to uncertainty when choosing a course, it was found that Bachelor of Music students were more certain that they wanted to study exactly their particular subject. The ages at which music and sport were started in childhood were similar, but the first-year music students were younger than the sport students were. Compared to sports students, music students decided their area of study earlier, and bachelor’s students in music in particular had fewer alternative study options than sports students.DiscussionThe results provide a differentiated picture of student motivation to study and thus allow a deeper insight into the subject cultures of music and sport.

Inductive thematic analysis, reflexive thematic analysis, and codes and themes within the data were created using NVivo Pro.ResultsThe main topics discussed by the female athletes were “gender inequality in general and in sport,” “barriers to gender equity,” “reasons for abandonment,” “needs,” “environment role models” and “tools for the gender equity in sport.” The main topics discussed by the sports managers, physical education teachers, and coaches were “gender inequality in general,” “gender inequality in sports,” “tools” and “reasons, motives, drivers.” The results of the study revealed that gender inequality in sports is influenced by a broader social context, where stereotypes, biases, and discrimination persist. The participants also highlighted the challenges, barriers, and needs that women athletes face in their careers, such as a lack of resources, support, visibility, and recognition. Moreover, the participants suggested some strategies to promote gender equity in sports, such as increasing investment, awareness, and education, creating policies and legislation, fostering women’s leadership and role modeling, and developing mixed and inclusive sports projects.DiscussionAccording to athletes and sports managers/teachers/coaches, gender inequality is still present in sport. There are barriers and challenges that need to be addressed such as lack of resources, visibility, and recognition for female athletes. Among the strategies that can be used to reverse this situation are increasing investment, awareness, and education, creating policies and legislation, fostering women’s leadership, and developing mixed and inclusive sport projects."

These word lists, despite their widespread use, did not take word meaning into consideration. Foreign language learners are unclear on which meanings they should focus on first. To address this issue, we semantically annotated the Corpus of Contemporary American English and the British National Corpus with high accuracy using a BERT model. From these annotated corpora, we calculated the semantic frequency of different senses and filtered out senses to create a High-frequency Sense List. Subsequently, we checked the validity of this list and compared it with established influential word lists. This list exhibits three notable characteristics. First, it achieves stable coverage in different corpora. Second, it identifies high-frequency items with greater accuracy. It achieves comparable coverage with lists like GSL, NGSL, and New-GSL but with significantly fewer items. Especially, it includes everyday words that used to fall off high-frequency lists without requiring manual adjustments. Third, it describes clearly which senses are most frequently used and therefore should be focused on by beginning learners. This study represents a pioneering effort in semantic annotation of large corpora and the creation of a word list based on semantic frequency."

Similar to images and facial expressions, visual words possess the ability to evoke emotional connotations. Understanding how the brain perceives these emotional nuances encoded in highly symbolic visual words is a key focus of the emerging field of “affective neurolinguistics.” At the core of this inquiry lies the examination of the early posterior negativity , an event-related potentials component peaking around ms after stimulus onset in the occipitotemporal scalp region. EPN has consistently emerged in response to emotional stimuli, encompassing pictures, faces, and visual words. However, prior research has notably lacked observation of EPN in response to Chinese emotional words, raising questions about potential differences in emotional processing between Chinese and other languages. Given the logographic nature of the Chinese writing system and the prevalence of compound words in the Chinese lexicon, this study aims to explore whether the emotional processing of Chinese monomorphic and compound words elicits an EPN response. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment utilized one-character words , while Experiment employed two-character words . Participants were assigned a go/no-go task, instructed to respond to unknown words or blue stimuli . Data analysis using a data-driven mass univariate approach revealed significant ERP differences between emotional and neutral words. Notably, the time course, scalp topography, and cortical generators of the difference ERP presented a characteristic EPN response in both experiments. These findings strongly support the notion that the processing of emotional connotations in both Chinese monomorphic and compound words is reflected by the EPN, paving the way for future research using EPN as an emotion-related ERP component for investigating emotional processing of Chinese words."

Over the past few years, several studies have investigated the effect of sensory input on motor timing; however, the evidence remains conflicting. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of sensory modality and tempo on the accuracy of timed movements and explore strategies for enhancing motor timing.MethodsParticipants performed synchronization and adaptation circle drawing tasks in virtual reality. In Experiment , participants synchronized circle drawing with repeated stimuli based on sensory modalities and tempos . In Experiment , we examined timing adaptation in circle drawing tasks under conditions of unexpected tempo changes, whether increased or decreased.ResultsA significant interaction effect between modality and tempo was observed in the comparison of timing accuracy. Tactile stimuli exhibited significantly higher timing accuracy at bpm, whereas auditory stimuli demonstrated a peak accuracy at bpm. The analysis revealed a significantly larger timing error when adapting to changes in the tempo-down condition compared with the tempo-up condition.DiscussionThrough Experiment , we found that sensory modality impacts motor timing differently depending on the tempo, with tactile modality being effective at a faster tempo and auditory modality being beneficial at a moderate tempo. Additionally, Experiment revealed that adapting to changes by correcting timing errors is more challenging with decreasing tempo than with increasing tempo. Our findings suggest that motor timing is intricately influenced by sensory modality and tempo variation. Therefore, to enhance the motor timing, a comprehensive understanding of these factors and their applications is imperative."

In this respect, early language acquisition is viewed as convergent and reliable but late acquisition is not. The present study revisits the idea of a critical period by investigating the grammatical attainment of early bilinguals/heritage speakers , late second/foreign language learners, and comparable groups of monolinguals by testing Greek-English bilinguals in the two languages they speak by means of a grammaticality judgment task. Our findings show that in English, HSs performed on par with monolinguals, both groups surpassing the late L learners, who performed about SDs below the HSs and the monolinguals. In Greek, late L learners and monolinguals exhibited comparable performance, contrasting sharply with the HSs’ significantly lower proficiency, which was on average about SDs below the late L learners and the monolinguals. Consequently, our results show that the performance gaps between HSs and Greek monolinguals/late L learners were more pronounced than the differences between late L learners and English monolinguals/HSs, suggesting that the early bilinguals’ success in English may come at the expense of their heritage language . Furthermore, we observe substantially more individual variation within HSs in their heritage language than within the late L learners for their second language.

Because of the strong influence of PBC on intentions/behavior, most important were control beliefs about the need for good time management.DiscussionThe present studies increased our understanding why many individuals do not allow time to obtain adequate sleep. Identification of the beliefs that distinguish between those who intend to allow time for adequate sleep and those who do not is a necessary step toward the design of effective interventions to improve sleep duration. The results indicate that a focus on increasing time management skills and PBC may be an effective approach for sleep interventions."

However, the protection of artistic creations, as forms of communication, is not only a right for artists but also serves as a crucial safeguard that nurtures them during the creative process. Beyond the traditional issues of copyright, the significant advancements in Artificial Intelligence in today’s digital world have introduced a new debate regarding the ownership of copyright in artistic creations generated by AI. The question arises whether copyright belongs to the AI itself or to the individuals who guide the creative process behind it. In this study, based on the concepts of art, artistic creation, and emotional states, copyright issues will be examined. Data obtained from semi-structured in-depth interviews with artists and academic experts in the field will be analysed through content analysis to explore their perspectives regarding the discussion on emotional states, AI, and copyrights. The research highlights the variability of emotional states and their significant effects on individuals. Addressing the increasing trend of copyright issues, particularly within the framework of digitalization and inadequate legal regulations, it was found that artists’ emotional states are negatively impacted by these problems. This negative influence can adversely affect artists’ creativity and desire to produce. On the other hand, it was also identified that in artworks produced especially through AI, if artists’ rights are not protected, there is a possibility of negative emotional states arising. In conclusion, suggestions are as follows: Emphasising the importance of awareness-raising educational activities nationally and internationally, national copyright law needs to be revised to protect traditional copyright and be expanded to include digital copyright, especially for works produced through AI. On an international level, emphasising the need to revise international agreements to include regulations for works produced through AI or to create a new agreement based on the importance of this issue."

The findings will offer educators and relevant departments valuable insights to understand and facilitate the restoration of learning capabilities among students affected by the disaster.MethodsThis study employed a combined approach of questionnaire surveys and longitudinal tracking. Students from Guangling Primary and Secondary School participated in surveys administered in September , December , and September . The instruments utilized included the Post-Disaster Trauma Assessment Questionnaire, the Adolescent Academic Control Scale, and the mathematical version of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire. Data analysis involved two-factor correlation and mediation effect testing.ResultsSignificant differences were observed in overall PTSD scores and its three dimensions between the -week and -year post-disaster assessments. Both the average PTSD score and the detection rate were higher year after the disaster compared to the first week. Students’ academic control demonstrated a strong positive correlation with positive academic emotions and a significant negative correlation with anxiety-related academic emotions. Cross-lagged regression analysis indicated a predictive relationship: academic control measured months post-disaster significantly predicted academic emotions at the -month assessment, and conversely, academic emotions at the -month point were predictive of academic control at months. In addition, academic control appears to play a complete mediating role in the relationship between PTSD and academic emotions.ConclusionStudents exhibited a range of PTSD symptoms following the disaster, with a higher prevalence noted in the first year compared to the initial week. PTSD negatively affects academic standing in these students, and is predictive of both their sense of academic control and their emotional responses to learning. Crucially, academic control and academic emotions exhibit a strong correlation and can mutually affect one another. Interventions aimed at reducing PTSD symptoms, cultivating positive academic emotions, and strengthening students’ sense of academic control must therefore consider the relationship between these factors. This holistic approach will enhance psychological well-being and improve academic performance."

In this work we propose a theoretical model, based on evidence, that shows the direct and indirect relationships between these factors and academic performance in mathematics courses, in undergraduate and school students.MethodsTo understand the type of relationships between these variables, the PANAS psychometric test of positive and negative affect, the BIG FIVE personality test and the economic decision game DUPLES GAME were applied. The study sample was students between and years of age from undergraduate and school .ResultsFrom a path analysis, statistically significant relationships were found, for example, a direct relationship between neuroticism and positive affect, which in turn is related to academic performance. We also found a direct relationship between neuroticism and negative affect, extraversion and positive affect. This allows us to propose that some of the independent variables of the model directly and indirectly influence the academic performance of students in the subject of mathematics.ConclusionPositive affect and negative affect directly affect academic performance in mathematics, neuroticism has a direct impact on negative affect and extraversion direct impact on positive affect. Consequently, there are direct and indirect relationships between personality traits and affective dimensions, which affect the academic performance of mathematics students."

Recent approaches emphasize the need to move away from categorical descriptions of symptom clusters towards a dimensional view of mental disorders. From the perspective of phenomenological psychopathology, this shift is not enough, as a more detailed understanding of patients’ lived experience is necessary as well. One phenomenology-informed approach suggests that we can better understand the nature of psychiatric disorders through personalized network models, a comprehensive description of a person’s lifeworld in the form of salient nodes and the relationships between them. We present a detailed case study of a patient with multiple comorbidities, maladaptive coping mechanisms, and adverse childhood experiences.MethodsThe case was followed for a period of two years, during which we collected multiple streams of data, ranging from phenomenological interviews, neuropsychological assessments, language analysis, and semi-structured interviews .

Dropout refers to a patient’s unilateral termination of treatment without the therapist’s knowledge or approval. Premature termination occurs when therapy is discontinued before achieving a sufficient reduction in initial problems.ObjectiveThis study explores the role of therapist’s emotional response , gender, psychotherapeutic orientation, and patient diagnosis in the context of psychotherapeutic failures.MethodA mixed-method approach was used. Fifty-nine Italian psychotherapists, practicing mostly privately with at least years of experience, were recruited through Italian professional internet websites. The Therapist Response Questionnaire and the Impasse Interview were administered to each psychotherapist. Each therapist was asked to reflect on their last dropout patient. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted with SPSS and T-LAB, respectively.ResultsThe quantitative analyses revealed that the most frequent countertransference response was Helpless/Inadequate, with female therapists experiencing this more frequently than male therapists. The qualitative analyses identified two main factors explaining most of the variance in countertransference responses: Parental/Protective versus Hostile/Angry, and Positive/Satisfying versus Helpless/Inadequate, with Helpless/Inadequate central. Additionally, the qualitative analysis of treatment interruption methods revealed two factors explaining over % of the variance. Lack of communication was linked to negative themes, while mediated and direct communication were associated with positive terms. Direct communication was characterized as useful, while mediated communication was linked to dropout and attachment figures.ConclusionUnder pressure, psychotherapists’ anxiety levels increase, often managed ambivalently or avoidantly.

The findings indicate that: marketing on social media significantly boosts intentions for eco-friendly purchases, and green trust positively affects the perceptions of information usefulness. Green trust and perceptions of information usefulness jointly act as mediators between social media marketing and eco-friendly purchase intentions, with green trust exhibiting a stronger effect . The multi-group analysis findings indicate significant disparities in several potential pathways as a result of moderating factors such as educational attainment, etc. The benefits are especially apparent in women, people with middle to high incomes, people with intermediate to high levels of education, and people who engage with social media for over three hours per day. Through the effect analysis between marketing on social media, green trust, and perceptions of information usefulness on consumers’ intentions towards eco-friendly purchases, this study offers insights to social media platforms, businesses, and policymakers, enabling them to enhance strategies for fostering eco-friendly consumer behavior through social media channels."

Studies suggest that perceptual information enables interpersonal coordination and that perceptual noise may even enhance coordination. However, how these perceptual factors influence interpersonal coordination dynamics between head and body movements remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of visual information on the interpersonal coordination of head and body movements during dyadic conversations.MethodsThe availability of visual information was manipulated by positioning a partition halfway between a pair of participants, and the conversations were recorded using a video camera. A video-based human pose estimation software was used to quantify each interlocutor’s head and body movements, which were submitted for cross-recurrence quantification analysis , to assess the degree of coordination between the interlocutors.ResultsThe results showed different effects between head- and body-movement coordination . The occlusion of visual information increased head-movement coordination, whereas it decreased body-movement coordination.DiscussionThe results suggest that a distinct mechanism may be present at the head- and body-movement coordination level and this study observed differing appearances of compensatory behaviors. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the complex relationships between interpersonal coordination dynamics and various kinds of communication constraints, such as long-term or short-term, and lower-order or higher-order level constraints."

Grounded in the person–environment fit theory, this empirical study quantitatively investigates the psychological mechanisms of person–job fit and person–organization fit in job burnout, highlighting the mediating role of work pressure. To test our hypotheses, we investigated employees from IT enterprises around China’s Pearl River Delta region. The findings reveal that person–job fit is negatively associated with job burnout and work pressure, while work pressure positively influences job burnout, partially mediating the relationship between person–job fit and job burnout. Similarly, person–organization fit negatively affects job burnout and work pressure. However, its direct influence on job burnout is insignificant, indicating that work pressure fully mediates the relationship between person–organization fit and job burnout. These findings are consistent with the person–environment fit theory, enhancing our understanding of how individuals fit with their jobs and how organizations affect job burnout through work pressure. This study offers valuable insights for organizations seeking to mitigate burnout and promote employee well-being."

Academic discipline was categorized into four groups: Health, Arts, Sciences, and Engineering. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the effect of academic discipline on sleep measures, and the effect of academic discipline, dysfunctional sleep attitudes, and sleep hygiene practices on insomnia, sleep quality and duration.Results, students completed the survey . Compared to Health students, Art students had worse dysfunctional sleep attitudes, hygiene, quality, and insomnia severity . This relationship disappeared after controlling for differences in mental health . Art students had longer sleep durations , whereas Engineering students had shorter sleep durations . When dysfunctional sleep attitudes and hygiene were included in the model, both academic discipline and sleep hygiene were associated with sleep duration. Sleep hygiene and attitudes were also associated with sleep quality and insomnia severity , while academic discipline was not .DiscussionThese results suggest differences in sleep quality across academic discipline are impacted by dysfunctional sleep attitudes, sleep hygiene, and mental health, whereas differences in sleep duration appear to be independent of these factors. Overall, students in different academic disciplines have unique relationships with sleep and thus may require targeted approaches to improve their sleep. Future interventions should focus on supporting sleep hygiene and attitudes to improve students’ sleep and well-being."

It also examined the impact of teacher support on achievement emotion profiles and the mediating effect of need satisfaction. A total of college students participated in the survey. A robust three-step latent profile analysis was employed to analyze the data. Four profiles of achievement emotions were identified: moderate mixed emotions, the blends of high positive emotions, the blends of moderate positive emotions, and high mixed emotions. Higher perceived teacher support was associated with a greater likelihood of being classified into the blends of moderate positive emotion profile or the blends of high positive emotion profile. Moreover, basic psychological need satisfaction mediated the relationship between teacher support and the four emotion profiles. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of teacher support in shaping achievement emotion profiles, helping to broaden the application of self-determination theory to explain the mechanism by which external support influences emotion profiles."

For this purpose, we employ two word-order patterns of two clausal constructions in Korean—suffixal passive and morphological causative—which contrast pertaining to the mapping between thematic roles and case-marking and the interpretive procedures driven by verbal morphology. We find that, while Korean heritage speakers demonstrate the same kind of acceptability-rating behaviour as monolingual Korean speakers do, their reading-time patterns are notably modulated by construction-specific properties, cognitive skills, and proficiency. This suggests a heritage speaker’s ability and willingness to conduct both parsing routes, induced by linguistic cues in a non-dominant language, which are proportional to the computational complexity involving these cues.

Increased anxiety stemming from earthquakes may prompt individuals to turn to spirituality as a coping mechanism, with spiritual transcendence believed to be an effective way to mitigate anxiety. In this study, Bali, which has a Far Eastern spiritual tradition, and Türkiye, the majority of whose population is Muslim, are discussed comparatively. In fact, the underlying reason for this choice is to examine whether there is a difference between Hindu belief, one of the Far Eastern religions as a spiritual tradition, and Islam, one of the monotheistic religions, regarding individuals’ ability to manage anxiety and some basic psychological reactions to the fear of earthquakes. An example of Bali’s Hindu tradition has been considered a representation of the Islamic tradition, one of the monotheistic religions in Türkiye. Given this phenomenon, the study took a quantitative approach, giving a novel conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between spiritual transcendence, seismic fear, job satisfaction, job security, life satisfaction, and the moderating influence of optimism. Empirical data were acquired via surveys issued via Google Form to a total of workers in Bali and Türkiye. The research data were analyzed using SmartPLS software and a structural equation modeling technique. Findings indicate that earthquake anxiety and the impact of spiritual transcendence on satisfaction and job security are stronger in Bali than in Türkiye. Additionally, spirituality holds greater significance for the Balinese sample compared to the Turkish sample. The study clarifies the implications of its findings and provides guidance for future research endeavors."

Cognitive function tests and self-administered questionnaires were completed by the participants three times: at baseline, after weeks of CT, and after a further weeks following cessation. We measured work performance with the question: “How would you rate your performance over the past weeks?” Responses were made via a visual analog scale . Cognitive function was assessed using the THINC-integrated tool, which is a brief, objective computerized cognitive assessment battery. For our computerized remote CT intervention, BrainHQ was used on the basis of our scientific rationale and the empirical literature. We recommended three -min sessions of BrainHQ per week and sent participants three reminders.ResultsIn total, participants were recruited to this study. Only .% of the subjects achieved the recommended training time of min over weeks. The median training time was used to divide participants into long and short- training groups.

However, in recent years, with increasing work pressure for clinical nurses, procrastination has become a prevalent issue. Many nurses use smartphones as a way to alleviate stress and manage emotions, but excessive smartphone use could exacerbate procrastination, thereby jeopardizing patient safety and healthcare quality. Therefore, understanding the current state of work procrastination among clinical nurses, its heterogeneity, and exploring the impact of smartphone addiction and demographic factors on different aspects of nurse procrastination hold significant importance for improving patient care quality.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the current state of work procrastination among clinical nurses and identify potential profile categories. It further analyzes the impact of mobile phone addiction and demographic factors on work procrastination among clinical nurses.MethodsConvenience sampling was employed to recruit participants from three tertiary hospitals in central China from October to November . Surveys measuring nurses’ work procrastination and smartphone addiction were distributed and collected through online platforms. A total of , nurses participated in this study. Mplus . statistical software was used for latent profile analysis of clinical nurses’ work procrastination, and SPSS . software was utilized for chi-square tests, rank-sum tests, and multi-classification logistic regression analyses.ResultsThe median total score for clinical nurses’ work procrastination was . , and three subgroups were identified: low procrastination , medium-low procrastination , and medium-high procrastination . Additionally, logistic regression analysis revealed that smartphone addiction and department atmosphere were common influencing factors for medium-low and medium-high work procrastination. Hospitals with stricter management and nurses holding the position of head nurse were more likely to belong to the low work procrastination group. Nurses with higher incomes or those holding intermediate titles were more prone to medium-low work procrastination, while those experiencing career advancement difficulties were more likely to exhibit medium-high work procrastination .ConclusionClinical nurses’ work procrastination is generally at a medium-to-low level, with three subgroups identified: low procrastination, medium-low procrastination, and medium-high procrastination. Additionally, clinical nurses in surgical departments or those with intermediate titles exhibit higher levels of procrastination. Factors such as smartphone addiction, higher monthly income, tense departmental atmosphere, and unsuccessful career advancement are more likely to lead to work procrastination. Conversely, nurses in hospitals with strict management or those holding the position of head nurse exhibit lower levels of work procrastination. Therefore, nursing managers should pay close attention to the work procrastination behaviors of clinical nurses, actively monitor predictive factors among different groups, and provide psychological counseling and relevant training based on individual nurse circumstances. Additionally, it is also essential to focus on and improve departmental atmosphere and nurse smartphone addiction to enhance clinical nurses’ work efficiency and reduce work procrastination."

Previous research, mostly from a single laboratory, has shown that externally imposed time constraints by means of text fading can enhance reading fluency in children and adults with varying reading abilities and in different languages.MethodsIn the present study, we aimed at replicating and extending previous results in Italian readers. Three experiments were conducted: to investigate the effects of continuous fading compared to character-wise fading, to investigate the influence of enlarged inter-letter spacing on reading acceleration outcomes, and to probe whether reading gains can be reliably observed off-line by comparing accelerated reading with an analog non-accelerated procedure.ResultsOverall, results corroborate previous findings revealing that participants read % faster during the reading acceleration procedure, while maintaining the same accuracy levels. Continuous fading proved to be more effective than character-wise fading in enhancing reading speed, while larger inter-letter spacing did not significantly affect the reading speed gain. Albeit the non-clinical nature of our sample and its numerosity circumscribe the potential generalization, taking into account individual differences in the initial reading time, data suggests that reading acceleration leads to larger off-line speed increments with respect to non-accelerated reading.DiscussionTaken together, these findings offer valuable insights for the future application of reading acceleration procedures as part of multisession training programs for improving reading proficiency in a diverse range of clinical and non-clinical populations."

This study assesses the effectiveness of a new skills-based training approach to improve risk recognition and reporting of malicious elicitations. Malicious elicitations are techniques that strategically use conversation with the sole purpose of collecting sensitive, non-publicly available information about business operations, people, or technological assets without raising suspicion. To an untrained observer, a skilled elicitor can make conversations seem analogous to many professional networking situations such as those experienced over email and at conferences. A -month longitudinal experimental study was conducted to test training effectiveness on employees of a large corporation that focuses on serving national security needs and the public interest. Half of participants were randomly assigned to receive traditional awareness-based training while the other half of participants received a new skills-based training that allowed them—over the course of five weeks—to iteratively practice skills learned in the training and receive feedback on their performance in their day-to-day work environment. Following training for both experimental groups, malicious elicitations and benign professional networking test messages were sent to unaware employee participants for months.

Existing literature focuses on overall PTSD severity rather than potential day-to-day fluctuations in specific symptoms, which might play a crucial role in understanding alcohol misuse risk. Studies also examine only same-day or next-day associations between PTSD and drinking, neglecting the potential for longer-term changes.MethodsThis study explores the short-term longitudinal stability and time-lagged predictive dynamics of PTSD symptoms, affect, and drinking behavior among female college heavy episodic drinkers over four weeks. Participants were categorized into three groups: those with a history of SV and PTSD , women with SV but without PTSD , and women without prior trauma history to be able to examine differences by trauma exposure, and PTSD. We compared the longitudinal stability of PTSD symptom networks, affect , and drinking behavior across groups. Support vector regression determined which PTSD symptom networks and affect best predict drinking behavior at specific time lags within a - day range.ResultsThe PTSD group showed higher longitudinal stability for PTSD symptom networks and arousal , but lower stability for negative affect and drinking behavior, including alcohol cravings and consumption , compared to the comparison groups. This suggests individuals with PTSD have more stable symptoms and arousal levels but greater fluctuations in negative affect and alcohol-related behaviors.

Because of greater salience, Russian speakers more often use prenominal positions for numerals than for color adjectives. The paper also investigates borderline cardinalities and argues for the order factor that affects their salience, since ordered items can be perceived in small subitized parts. The ordered mode of presentation of the borderline cardinalities leads to higher over-specification rates and to higher percentages of prenominal positions than the unordered one.

Similarly, it may be hard for parents to detect their children’s subtle expressions. These challenges in accessibility may compromise emotional availability in parent–child interactions. The systematic use of the bodily-tactile modality for expressive and receptive communicative functions may function as a strategy to compensate for a child’s lack of vision. This multiple-case study explored the effects of a bodily-tactile early intervention for three mothers and their one-year-old children with VIAD.MethodsVideo data from baseline, intervention, and follow-up sessions were analyzed using a bodily-tactile coding procedure and EA Scales.ResultsDuring the intervention, all mothers began to use a more bodily-tactile modality in early play routines and in different communicative functions. They increased their use of anticipatory cues, noticing responses, and tactile signs. Moreover, the children were more emotionally available to their mothers during the intervention and follow-up compared to the baseline.ConclusionThe results indicated that, during a short intervention, mothers could adopt a systematic use of the bodily-tactile modality in interactions with their children with VIAD. The results also suggest that, when mothers increased flexibility in communication channels, it was positively linked to their children’s EA."

The results highlighted that individuals with SLD exhibit higher levels of anxiety and depression and lower resilience compared to the control group. The Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale – Short Form, which explores perfectionism, did not reveal differences between the groups. Conversely, lower scores emerged in SLD students for the intrinsic motivation sub-scales of the Academic Motivation Scale. This indicates less engagement in studying out of personal cognitive curiosity. The Self-Regulated Knowledge Scale – University, which measures various cognitive strategies, showed significantly lower scores in the SLD group for knowledge linking, knowledge training, and knowledge critique.

The management of emotions is an integral part of teachers’ professional work, and it is essential to clarify their emotional experiences and the generating of their emotions within a specific cultural context.MethodsBased on a phenomenological approach and the use of anecdotal texts, this study examined six common emotional states among teachers, including happiness, guilt, worry, fear, annoyance, and anger, along with the emotional experiences of two specialised categories of teachers, class supervisors, and pre-service teachers. The factors influencing teachers’ emotions and their generative mechanisms were analysed.Results and discussionThis investigation found that key influences on teachers’ emotions stem from factors within the teachers’ themselves, the contextual nature of their work, and sociocultural dynamics. Drawing on the analytical frameworks of emotional geography theory, ecological theory of human development, and the ecosystem model of teachers’ emotional interactions, the study constructs a model highlighting the generative mechanisms of teachers’ emotions, and in which three systems are reflected.ConclusionTeachers’ personal attributes are in the direct area of the model and directly govern the formation of their emotions, while their work context consists of a transitional area in emotion formation and the sociocultural system acts as the latent band influencing emotion development.

Following this, two external judges rated whether there were any elements related to ‘negative relationships with others’ in both waking-life experiences and dreams. In addition, the judges assessed if there was any content related to ‘being chased or pursued’ in both waking-life experiences and dreams.ResultsThe frequency of dreaming of ‘negative relationships with others’ was higher than the frequency of the same topic in waking-life experiences, which in turn was higher than the frequency of typical theme dreaming of ‘being chased or pursued’. In addition, ‘negative relationships with others’ in waking-life experiences were correlated with both dreaming of ‘being chased or pursued’, and ‘negative relationships with others’ in dreams.ConclusionThese results suggested that the typical theme ‘being chased or pursued’ in dreams may represent some waking-life experiences metaphorically.

Drawing on Lazarus and Folkman’s transactional model of stress and coping, we propose that employees’ appraisal of their daily tasks may explain why multitasking has negative implications for flow and job performance. Moreover, we expect that daily work engagement can buffer the detrimental effects of multitasking on flow and job performance. A total of professional workers in the food industry participated in our study and were asked to respond to daily surveys at work across weeks. In line with our expectations, results showed that on days when employees’ working time was highly fragmented across a high number of tasks, they experienced less flow and, in turn, their job performance was lower on that particular day. Moreover, appraisal of daily tasks as less challenging – though not more hindering – explained why multitasking impairs flow.

Two proposed chains of mediation capture the potential mechanisms underlying this process. The first chain involves the task and knowledge characteristics of work design, specifically autonomy arrangements and skill-based job demands, as mediators. The second chain focuses on the social and physical/contextual aspects of work design, including social support and ergonomic working conditions. The study sample consisted of , Chinese employees aged between and years . Our findings reveal that a positive psychological age climate—organizational norms and practices that value and support older workers—significantly boosts their motivation to continue working. This enhancement in motivation is mediated by increased job autonomy and robust social support within the workplace, confirming that these elements are crucial for translating a positive age climate into tangible outcomes. Contrary to existing literature, our research does not support the mediating role of job design tailored to aged workers’ skills and ergonomic working conditions. This indicates that in the cultural and organizational context of China, where collective values and respect for elder wisdom predominate, autonomy and social support directly influence workers’ motivation more profoundly than ergonomic and job design considerations. The study underscores the importance of creating inclusive organizational cultures and implementing targeted support strategies to retain and engage aged workers effectively.

However, further investigation is warranted to ascertain which types of exercise motivation may have more influence on the MH of college students. The present study examined the direct effects of five distinct types of exercise motivation, namely health motivation , appearance motivation , fun motivation , ability motivation , and social motivation on MH. Additionally, the study explored the potential mediating role of physical exercise in these relationships.MethodsAn cross-sectional study design was employed. A total of Chinese college students participated in the study and completed our questionnaires, which included the Exercise motivation scale , the Physical exercise scale , and the Mental health scale .ResultsThe findings revealed a significant and positive relationship between all five categories of exercise motivation and the MH of college students. Specifically, FM was found to have the most pronounced impact on MH, followed by HM, ABM, SM, and APM, in descending order of influence. Furthermore, the impacts of HM, FM, ABM, and SM on MH were found to be partially mediated by PE. However, the association between APM and MH was entirely mediated by PE.DiscussionThe present study contributes to enhancing the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms behind different exercise motivations in relation to PE and MH.

The Big Five personality traits are widely used frameworks that help describe people’s psychological behaviours. These traits predict how individuals behave within an organizational setting.MethodsIn this article, we introduce a virtual reality strategy for relatively scoring an individual’s personality to evaluate the feasibility of predicting personality traits from implicit measures captured from users interacting in VR simulations of different organizational situations. Specifically, eye-tracking and decision-making patterns were used to classify individuals according to their level in each of the Big Five dimensions using statistical machine learning methods. The virtual environment was designed using an evidence-centered design approach.ResultsThe dimensions were assessed using NEO-FFI inventory. A random forest ML model provided % accuracy in predicting agreeableness. A k-nearest neighbour ML model provided %, %, and % accuracy in predicting openness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, respectively. A support vector machine model provided % accuracy for predicting extraversion. These analyses indicated that the dimensions could be differentiated by eye-gaze patterns and behaviours during immersive VR.DiscussionEye-tracking measures contributed more significantly to this differentiation than the behavioural metrics. Currently, we have obtained promising results with our group of participants, but to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings, it is imperative to replicate the study with a considerably larger sample. This study demonstrates the potential of VR and ML to recognize personality traits."

We investigated children who were exposed to Spanish since infancy but varied in their amount of cumulative English exposure. In addition to the visual word paradigm, all children completed an article–noun naming task, a grammaticality judgment task, and standardized vocabulary tests. Parents reported on their child’s cumulative English language exposure and current English language use. To investigate the time course of lexical facilitation effects, looks to the target were analyzed with a cluster-based permutation test. The results revealed that all children used gender in a facilitatory way , and comprehension was significantly inhibited when the article–noun pairing was ungrammatical rather than grammatical. Compared to children with less cumulative English exposure, children with more cumulative English exposure looked at the target noun significantly less often overall, and compared to younger children, older children looked at the target noun significantly more often overall.

Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of ErrPs is crucial to ensure reliable BCI outcomes. In this study, we investigated ErrPs in the context of the “guess what I am thinking” paradigm. healthy participants were instructed to imagine an object from a predetermined set, while an algorithm randomly selected another object that was either the same as or different from the imagined object. We recorded and analyzed the participants’ EEG activity to capture their mental responses to the algorithm’s “predictions”. The study identified components distinguishing correct from incorrect responses. It discusses their nature and how they differ from ErrPs extensively studied in other BCI paradigms. We observed pronounced variations in the shape of ErrPs across different stimulus sets, underscoring the significant influence of visual stimulus appearance on ErrP peaks.

Therefore, we used the same sequences of orientation items, orientation estimation task, and computational models, to examine temporal interference over both short and long intervals. We further examined how inter-item similarity modifies these different instances of temporal interference. Qualitatively different results emerged for interference of different scales. Interference over long intervals mainly degraded the precision of the target encoding while interference over short intervals mainly affected the signal-to-noise ratio. Although both interference instances modulated substitution errors and were alleviated with dissimilar items, their characteristics were markedly disparate. These findings suggest that different mechanisms mediate temporal interference of different scales."

Individual differences in children’s sensitivity to ARTs have been related to the development of children’s phonological processing skills across languages by the Temporal Sampling theory. Impaired processing of ARTs also characterises children with dyslexia. However, different ART tasks have been employed in different studies, in different languages, and at different ages. Here, we compare the sensitivity of three frequently used ART tasks in a longitudinal study of English-speaking children with and without dyslexia. Children’s ability to discriminate rising frequency, duration, and intensity was also tested. ART discrimination in all tasks was significantly inter-related, but different relations to phonology and literacy were found for different ART tasks at different ages. In particular, the often-used sine tone and speech-shaped noise ART tasks showed greater sensitivity in older children, while the synthetic syllable task showed greater sensitivity in younger children. Sensitivity to rising frequency was also related to phonology and literacy across ages. The data are interpreted with respect to the Temporal Sampling theory of developmental dyslexia."

They learned word-lists with either a repetition strategy, low resource demanding but less efficient, or a mental imagery strategy, high resource demanding but more efficient. Openness was measured with the Big- personality questionnaire.ResultsABST reduced memory performance and disrupted more the recall of words learned with the imagery strategy. The results also showed that openness predicted recall performance associated with the imagery strategy only in the threatened group.ConclusionThese results indicated that a high level in openness may disrupt the negative effect of ABST by improving the capacity of threatened people to execute efficient, resource demanding memory strategies. This finding supports the idea that contextual factors as well as individual characteristics such as personality, need to be considered when assessing episodic memory in aging."

Even within the context of situated theories of cognition and agency that take the organism-environment system as central in their investigations, the notion of “situation” has been undertheorized. Yet, whether affordances are relevant depends on the situation. Therefore, Van Dijk and Rietveld argue that we must understand the practical situation in which behavior occurs in order to know how we respond to the affordances that the materials and other people offer. Taking John Dewey’s notion of “situation” as the basis for investigation, I follow Shaun Gallagher’s analysis of how we are not just part of a situation, but we understand what an action is only in relation to a situation. Situations act like large-scale affordances, but this does not mean that affordances are inviting or soliciting as such. Because of the situational transactions with the environment that an agent has, the environment pushes and pulls the agent from and toward certain actions. This means that environments have expressive qualitative features that are non-subjective emotional qualities and social gestalt. I propose four overlapping but distinct features or axes of analysis of situations that can be identified and analyzed in terms of how they shape our agency: complexity, determinedness, the establishment of expectations, and restrictiveness. Situations can be more or less complex in a spatial, temporal, or layered way. They can also be more or less determined, meaning that the agent’s actions are more or less obvious. Third, they can be characterized as socially established, meaning that certain behavior is expected. Finally, situations are more or less restricted, denoting the number of activities available to an agent."

After verifying normality, a t-test and ANOVA were used to compare groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient and path analyses were also utilized for data analysis.ResultsIn terms of loneliness, there were significant differences between genders in preclinical and clinical term groups, and stress levels were also significantly different between the two term groups. Men were found to be more emotionally lonely than women. No significant difference was observed for academic burnout across gender and term groups. Perceived stress played a mediator role between emotional loneliness and academic burnout, while social loneliness had almost no effect on either stress or academic burnout. Stress increased significantly as educational levels increased.ConclusionsAccording to the results, emotional loneliness and stress increase academic burnout.

The best evidenced mechanism through which this occurs is where networks act as a vehicle to access social support. Little is known about the content and function of social networks of children of parents with severe and enduring mental illness . COPMI are a frequently under-identified vulnerable child population at risk of negative outcomes. This qualitative study investigates the structure, role and function of these children’s networks.MethodsResearchers conducted semi-structured egocentric social network interviews. Interviews incorporated personal network mapping as a data collection method. COPMI were recruited through third sector organizations and interviewed across three sites in England. Data was analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis.ResultsFive network features were identified parents as primary providers of support limited networks and diminished connections over time substitutable ties peer connections as source of both support and strain coping strategies: self-censorship, avoidance and animals.ConclusionChildren of parents with severe and enduring mental illness networks are structurally typical of vulnerable children in that they are limited, rely on parents as primary ties but allow for some substitution of support ties. COPMI-specific features included peer relationships at times as source of strain and network level coping strategies used to manage wellbeing, including pets. This latter reflects previous findings in vulnerable adult populations so far unevidenced in children. Little evidence as to the mechanistic effect at work within networks was collected. However, COPMI were clearly shown to be engaged in active management and strategising in network navigation approaches, indicating the need to engage with children in this capacity, rather than approaching them as passive recipients of support. As such, effective network level interventions for this group are likely to prioritize access to beneficial substitute ties when support is limited. Additionally, interventions that promote network navigation skills and help foster productive coping strategies can capitalize on the child’s active management role within their network."

Some studies suggested that individuals with high Environmental Sensitivity may have been more likely to experience poor psychological adjustment during the pandemic than those with lower sensitivity. However, there is still limited research on how emotional responses varied across different stages of the pandemic and whether Environmental Sensitivity increased adolescents’ vulnerability to the psychological impact of prolonged pandemic restrictions.MethodsTo address this gap, this study used a three-year longitudinal design with a sample of adolescents. They completed an online survey measuring their positive and negative emotions throughout the pandemic period, with Environmental Sensitivity considered a time-invariant covariate.ResultsThe results revealed that all participants, regardless of their level of Environmental Sensitivity, experienced a decrease in positive emotionality between the first and second years. However, this trend reversed, showing an increase between the second and third years. Regarding negative emotions, highly sensitive adolescents experienced a significant linear increase over time. In contrast, low-and medium-sensitive adolescents exhibited a quadratic trend, with a notable increase in negative emotions between the first and second years, followed by a slight decrease between the second and third years.DiscussionThese findings provide further evidence of the negative impact of the pandemic on adolescents’ emotional well-being. They also support the notion that Environmental Sensitivity is associated with individuals’ ability to respond and adjust to adverse life events, with significant implications for future research and practice."

This study aims to integrate the autonomy-supportive and laissez-faire coaching styles within the same measurement framework.MethodsOur study developed a comprehensive scale to assess both the autonomy-supportive and laissez-faire coaching styles, drawing on items from the Sport Climate Questionnaire for autonomy support and adapting items from leadership research for laissez-faire coaching. We conducted two studies: the first with athletes to refine the laissez-faire items and the second with athletes to validate the full scale, utilizing exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation analysis. We also measured internal consistency and split-half reliability.ResultsThe finalized scale includes a -item autonomy-supportive subscale and a -item laissez-faire subscale. Validation processes confirmed the scale’s construct and criterion validity, alongside its reliability.DiscussionThe Chinese Coaches’ Autonomy-Supportive—Laissez-Faire Coaching Style Scale effectively captures both the beneficial and potentially detrimental aspects of coaching styles, addressing a critical gap in the literature and providing a reliable tool for evaluating coaching approaches."

Despite a large number of qualitative accounts evidencing persistent sexism and gender exclusion in the field, there exists a lack of empirical data to assess the scale of this phenomenon and substantiate smaller-scale research on gender inequality. In this paper, we employ boundary theory to report on a quantitative investigation of gender marginalization in jazz and improvisation in the Australian context, positioning gender as a symbolic boundary resulting in the social exclusion and marginalization of gender diverse individuals and women. An anonymous survey was run over a period of five months, to explore the beliefs, attitudes, and experiences concerning gender, of people participating in Australian jazz and improvisation. A means comparison found that gender was a statistically significant indicator on almost all measures, with gender diverse respondents significantly more likely to report the effects of marginalization than their counterparts. Additionally, the results indicated contrasting forms of musical engagement and marginalization across gender groups, with women perceiving exclusion to a lesser extent than gender diverse practitioners, and differing in their opinions regarding work opportunities. Lastly, a widespread but historically unspoken awareness of sexual harassment in the Australian jazz and improvisation industry was reported by all genders. This paper concludes with three recommendations for future research, policy and practice: . Specific targeted strategies are needed to address the manifold and complex forms of marginalization experienced by gender diverse people; . Heightened institutional visibility for marginalized groups is needed to change gendered narratives and highlight awareness of inequities; and . Enhanced safety measures are critically needed to address sexual harassment throughout the industry."

One possible reason is university students’ difficulties in coping with stress. Repetitive negative thinking is a transdiagnostic process that, when combined with stress, can lead to the development of various disorders. We aim to determine the effect of stress and RNT on predicting various mental health syndromes in university students across days.MethodProspective observational study using Momentary Ecological Assessment with the OURMIND Mobile App. On day one, university students responded to the SCL-R questionnaire for symptoms of depression, anxiety, hostility, obsession, psychoticism, paranoia, somatization, and interpersonal sensitivity; RNT styles questionnaires, RRS for rumination and negative reflection, PSWQ for worry; SISCO-II for term academic stress, and sociodemographic. EMA consisted of five assessments a day for days; each time, the students answered items about academic and non-academic stress , reactive RNT duration and intrusiveness , and reactive RNT rumination, reflection, and worry . On day eight, symptoms were re-assessed. Seven hierarchical stepwise linear regression models were used to test the predictive power of the study variables in the development of SCL-R symptoms.ResultsWhen comparing models, adding baseline symptoms increased the models’ predictive power in all symptom groups. In most cases, including EMA-stress generated greater predictive power, except for paranoia and interpersonal sensitivity. Adding the EMA-RNT process increased the prediction of paranoia and obsessive symptoms; for hostility symptoms, RNT styles increased predictive power. For the final regression models, considering the initial symptoms, the EMA-RNT process predicted the progression of symptoms in six out of eight groups, while EMA-non-academic stress predicted the remaining two. Additionally, living with other relatives or friends was a predictor of depressive symptoms.DiscussionThe stress of university life impacts the development of psychiatric symptoms in university students. These results provide evidence of RNT as a transdiagnostic process in several syndromic groups.

In Experiment , explicit feedback was given in the training block after each response to rate proportions of % as “many,” whereas % is normally rather rated as “few.” The objective was to determine whether people with fluent or non-fluent aphasia were able to process quantifiers appropriately and whether generalized semantic flexibility was present after brain damage. Sixteen out of patients were able to perform the task. People with fluent aphasia showed the expected polarity effect in the reaction times and shifted their criteria for “many” with generalization to the untrained quantifier “few.” This effect, however, was only obtained after explicit feedback but not by mere adaptation . In contrast, people with non-fluent aphasia did not change the quantifier semantics in either experiment. This study contributes to gaining new insights into quantifier processing and semantic flexibility in people with aphasia and general underlying processing mechanisms."

The ESC is an example for anticipative processes in manual action. ESC planning is investigated in many studies where this effect is measured in the context of motor observation and motion capture. However, there is little evidence if the anticipative link between different action states, especially between initial grasp postures and comfortable end postures, is represented in memory. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the perception of a grasp posture holding a bar leads to the activation of action-related representations of grasping actions. For this purpose, a priming paradigm was used in which prime images were shown depicting either a comfortable or uncomfortable grasp posture holding a two-colored bar. The subsequently shown target images represented either a comfortable or uncomfortable final grasp posture of this grasping action. Due to the different grasp postures in the prime and target, prime-target pairs represented different types of action sequences. Furthermore, physically possible, and physically impossible actions were presented. Participants were asked to react to the top color of the bar shown in the target-picture, whereby the shown grasp posture was irrelevant for this decision. Results showed that reaction times did not differ after presentation of an overhand grip to target pictures showing comfortable or uncomfortable final grasp postures. In contrast, after presentation of an underhand grip in the prime, reactions to target pictures with final comfortable grasp postures were faster compared to target pictures with uncomfortable grasp postures. The effect was only found for the physically possible action. The findings suggest that the perception of the underhand grip leads to cognitive pre-activation of a final action state. The present study suggests that the association between an initial uncomfortable underhand grip and its action effect, in form of a final action state that is consistent with the ESC, is represented in memory. Such motor representation might be important for the anticipation and control of goal-directed grasping."

Literature on dual-task paradigms that combine sport-relevant elements is scarce. Therefore, a novel paradigm combining cyclical speed of the lower extremities and concurrent visuo-verbal speed reading was tested and validated.

We hypothesized occurrence of dual-task costs in all athletes without relationship to single task performance. Differences in dual-task cost were expected between open-skill and closed-skill sports, as well as differing expertise levels. Level of cognitive function was expected to explain some variance in dual-task cost.MethodsA total of elite athletes participated in this study. Each athlete performed a tapping task, a visuo-verbal speed-reading task, and both tasks simultaneously. All ice hockey athletes performed additional cognitive tests assessing processing speed, spatial working memory, sustained attention, two choice reaction time, and motor inhibition.ResultsThe results of paired-sample t-tests confirmed significant dual-task costs for all sport groups . Single-task performance and dual-task costs correlated weakly in a positive direction.

Lastly, no significant regression model was found to predict dual-task costs from cognitive test performance.DiscussionOur study suggests that this novel dual-task paradigm was successful in inducing dual-task costs for all elite athletes. Since it distinguishes between closed-skill and open-skill sports athletes, it might be a valuable diagnostic tool for performance and for talent development of open-skill athletes. Dual-task costs could not be relevantly predicted via cognitive performance measures, questioning cognitive resource theories as an explanation for dual-task costs."

Based on Affective Disposition Theory, it hypothesizes that players’ moral judgments of characters significantly affect their engagement and enjoyment of VR narratives.MethodsA post-test between-subjects experiment was conducted with participants to examine the influence of character morality on guilt through the mediation of self-attribution, and how these factors affect players’ sense of presence and overall enjoyment in VR games.ResultsThe findings indicate that self-attribution significantly mediates the relationship between character morality and guilt. Additionally, the sense of presence enhances enjoyment, with a stronger sense of ‘being there’ amplifying the emotional impact of players’ moral decisions.DiscussionThis study highlights the full mediating effect of self-attribution in the context of VR gaming, intensifying players’ emotional responses to moral dilemmas. The results suggest that VR game designers should consider the moral implications of game narratives and character actions to create more emotionally engaging and ethically reflective gaming experiences. These insights have significant implications for VR game design and ethics, promoting greater ethical sensitivity among players."

In previous years, several large-scale national surveys have focused on their use by students at university, including drug types, prevalence rates, and predictive factors. The recent coronavirus pandemic brought about widespread structural changes for UK universities, as students were forced to adapt to home-based learning and in many cases reduced academic support. No study has yet focused primarily on the impact of pandemic social restrictions on PCE in students and academic staff, and whether personality and demographic factors reveal user profiles that predict use during the pandemic period.MethodA convenience sample of UK students and staff aged – completed a cross-sectional survey assessing PCE prevalence rates, polydrug use, perceived effects, academic self-efficacy and personality during the first year of social restrictions compared with the previous year .ResultsThere was a significant self-reported rise in the use of all drug types during social restrictions, particularly with Modafinil , nutraceuticals and microdose LSD . Respondents also indicated stronger PCE effects for all substances, except alcohol, in comparison to the previous year. Polydrug use with modafinil and other prescription stimulants increased the most during social restrictions. Personality factors and gender identity reliably predicted PCE use and lower agreeableness was often the strongest predictor, followed by identifying as male and lower conscientiousness. Academic self-efficacy and student/academic staff status were not consistent predictors.ConclusionThis is the first survey of UK students to investigate PCE during coronavirus social restrictions and to assess predictive factors. Findings reveal a rise in PCE use and polydrug use which we suggest is because of increased pressures on students created by the lockdown and reduced access to university resources."

While the existing literature extensively delves into the components of this system, scant attention is paid to its interplay with mentalization, theory of mind, and assertiveness. Moreover, gender disparities in dominance behaviors are largely studied in terms of biological variables and clinical populations. This study aims to understand the relationships between activation strategies of the dominance behavioral system, mentalization processes, theory of mind abilities, and levels of social discomfort in assertive communication. Moreover, to identify gender differences in the dominance behavioral system in a non-clinical sample.MethodsOur sample was composed of students from a non-clinical population. They claimed the absence of any psychological, neurological, or developmental disorders.ResultsA regression analysis was performed, and we found that levels of mentalization predict levels of hyperactivation of dominance behavioral system, but no significant results for the deactivation levels of the system were found. Moreover, no gender differences were found in levels of activations of the dominance behavioral system.ConclusionThese findings underscore the pivotal role of mentalization abilities in interpersonal dynamics, emphasizing the need for individuals to navigate social interactions adeptly. Furthermore, our research unveils implications for individual well-being and psychopathology, urging further investigation into how these dimensions intersect with various psychological disorders. By discerning the intricate mechanisms at play, we can develop targeted therapeutic interventions tailored to specific behavioral patterns, ultimately enhancing psychological resilience and fostering healthier social relationships in a non-clinical population."

Drawing from the transactional model of flow and stress, we argue that a build-up of mindfulness over the training duration not only leads to a decrease in stress but also an increase in flow experience. Thereby, we examine the moderating role of emotional exhaustion amplifying the beneficial effects of mindfulness.MethodsIn a quasi-experimental study, participants completed weekly questionnaires over the course of weeks. Forty six participants in the experimental group took part in the MBSR program, while participants were part of an inactive control group.ResultsMindfulness and flow showed a significant linear increase over time, whereas stress exhibited a linear decrease. Those who participated in the MBSR training reported an increase in mindfulness that positively and negatively predicted the trajectories of flow and stress, respectively. Emotional exhaustion amplified the effects of the trajectory of mindfulness on the trajectories of flow and stress.DiscussionThese findings suggest that mindfulness can not only reduce stress but can also foster the autotelic experience of flow, especially for chronically depleted individuals. However, more research is necessary to replicate these results and address the limitations of the current study, including the quasi-experimental design, the use of self-report measures, as well as the dropout during the study period."

In Sweden, women are particularly at risk to develop stress-related ill-health during a period in life that coincides with child-rearing years. When entering motherhood, Swedish women’s sick leave substantially increases. Yet, motherhood is rarely acknowledged in clinical encounters concerning pain and exhaustion although women suffer from these ailments more often than men. To incorporate motherhood as an existential dimension of health in the care of women living with pain and exhaustion might alleviate women’s suffering. But knowledge on women’s experiences of motherhood and health is scarce. Therefore, the aim of the study is to reach a deeper understanding of how women suffering from long-lasting pain and exhaustion experience their health in relation to motherhood.MethodsRicoeur’s interpretation theory has been applied to analyze phenomenological interviews with mothers suffering from long-lasting pain and exhaustion.ResultsThese women’s experiences shed light on how closely motherhood is interwoven with the experience of their health and suffering: The women’s suffering seems to be rooted in a relational vulnerability that has been uncovered during motherhood. Further, the women suffer from a burden of difficult life experiences and inner conflicts. Reconciliation with life is possible when women find an existential shelter, which offers ways to relate to their suffering making the own suffering more bearable."

This study aims to investigate MOL among Chinese adolescents with NS, identifying key factors influencing their sense of meaning and examining the interrelations with Subjective Well-Being and Psychological Security .MethodsEmploying a cross-sectional survey design, we analyzed adolescents with NS from Baise City, Guangxi, using the Purpose in Life scale alongside PS and SWB scales. Sociodemographic and disease-related variables were assessed for their impact on MOL. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression, and correlation analyses to explore predictors of MOL and its association with SWB and PS.ResultsA significant proportion of participants exhibited MOL scores below the threshold, indicating diminished life meaning. Critical factors impacting MOL included ‘left-behind’ status, family structure, educational disruptions, and NS duration. Strong correlations emerged between MOL, SWB , and PS, highlighting the interdependence of these psychological dimensions. The study further revealed ‘Proactivity’ as a vital component of MOL, suggesting that despite their challenges, adolescents with NS maintain a keen engagement with life.

Based on social identity theory, this study uses WeChat, a social platform popular in China, to analyze intergenerational differences in emoji understanding and preferences through a questionnaire survey. The results indicate: There are significant intergenerational differences in the usage habits, interpretation, and aesthetic preferences of emojis. Middle-aged and elderly tend to interpret goodbye emoji symbols as simple emotional expressions, such as “goodbye” or “see you later,” while younger-age groups lean towards more complex emotions and social intentions, such as “speechlessness” and “end of friendship.” Younger-age groups use emojis frequently and with a wide variety, whereas middle-aged and elderly groups use emojis less frequently and with limited variety. Younger individuals’ aesthetic preferences for emojis lean towards humor, conflict, and narrative, whereas middle-aged and elderly groups prefer emojis with bright colors and everyday greetings typical of their generation. Based on research findings, we believe that social identity theory provides a framework for understanding how individuals establish their identities through interactions with specific social groups.

However, the impact of context effects on exit decisions in emergency situations has not been thoroughly explored. Therefore, this article identifies three basic independent variables: context effects, crowd flows, and gender differences, to study the exit decisions of different gender groups facing different crowd flows, as well as how context effects affect existing exit decisions.MethodsIn this paper, we used virtual reality technology to construct an indoor fire scene and designed a total of virtual experiments with different crowd distribution or context effects. participants were divided into two groups, male and female, and their exit decisions were observed under different crowd flows and contextual effects.ResultsThe research results show that: ) Both men and women have an innate preference to avoid crowded exits, and the proportion of following crowd evacuation significantly decreases when there are crowded crowds in the scene; ) The exit decisions of female participants are more influenced by the crowd, while men tend to be more influenced by context effects when evacuating independently; ) The context effects on exit decisions in emergency situations is statistically significant, and this performance is more significant in the male population. Further analysis reveals that similarity effects have a more significant impact on exit decisions than attraction effects.DiscussionsThese findings provide deeper insights into the exit choice behavior of the population and may contribute to the design of safe exits in indoor buildings.

The relevance of studying the link between ego identity and goal self-concordance lies in understanding how a well-defined ego identity can foster the pursuit of authentic and fulfilling goals.ObjectivesThis study investigates the relationship between ego identity and goal self-concordance, focusing on how individuals’ sense of identity influences their alignment with personal goals.MethodsData were gathered through a cross-sectional analysis of students and a longitudinal follow-up with participants over two intervals.ResultsResults confirmed significant correlations between ego identity status and various dimensions of goal self-concordance. Notably, different ego identity statuses exhibited distinct levels of goal self-concordance, ranked from highest to lowest as follows: identity achievement, achievement-foreclosure intermediate, moratorium, foreclosure, moratorium-diffusion intermediate, and diffusion. Cross-lagged analysis revealed a causal relationship where ego identity influences goal self-concordance, providing insights into the cognitive and behavioral processes involved in goal setting.DiscussionThis study extends the implications of the goal self-concordance model and reveals a causal relationship between ego identity status and goal self-concordance. From a practical perspective, our findings suggest that educational and developmental interventions aimed at supporting identity development and commitment could lead to more self-concordant goal setting. Such programs could ultimately promote greater well-being and personal growth among students."

Three frameworks exist to explain the process: consciousness arises in an all-or-none manner; consciousness arises gradually; consciousness arises either all at once or gradually, depending on the level of stimulus processing . However, the development of emergent processes of consciousness remains unclear. This study examines the development of emergent processes of consciousness based on the level of stimulus processing framework.MethodsNinety-nine children and adults participated in two online discrimination tasks. These tasks involved color discrimination as lower-level processing and number magnitude discrimination as higher-level processing, as well as backward masking with stimulus onset asynchronies varying from . to . ms. We measured objective discrimination accuracy and used a -scale Perceptual Awareness Scale to assess subjective awareness. We fit the data to a four-parameter nonlinear function to estimate the center of the slope and the range of the slope of the model.ResultsThe results showed the threshold of objective discrimination was significantly higher in – year-olds than in – year-olds, but not of subjective awareness. The emergent process of objective discrimination in the number task was more gradual than in the color task.DiscussionThe findings suggest that the thresholds of subjective awareness in – year-olds and objective discrimination in – year-olds are similar to those in adults. Moreover, the emergent processes of subjective awareness and objective discrimination in – year-olds are also similar to those in adults. Our results support the level of processing hypothesis but suggest that its effects may differ across developmental stages."

Participants were selected from three types of high school with regards to the graduation system. We analysed the data using consensual qualitative research and thematic analysis.ResultsBased on the statements of the adolescents, we identified five main themes of factors that affect their academic performance. Adolescents reported that the following contribute to their academic performance: the contents and methods of teaching; how teachers behave and do their jobs; the way in which adolescents study and what motivates them; support within and outside the school, and the environment and appearance of the school.

These words provide valuable insights into how semantic representation is retrieved and selected independently of orthography and phonology. This study aims to investigate the temporal dynamics of lexical and semantic processing in the visual recognition of Korean words. Specifically, we examine how homonyms and unambiguous words are processed differently during a lexical decision task with EEG recording, considering the effects of word frequency and the number of meanings .MethodsParticipants performed a lexical decision task where they were required to determine if a visually presented stimulus was a valid Korean word. We compared the behavioral responses and event-related potentials evoked by homonyms and unambiguous words, each possessing either high or low word frequency. Both subjective and objective NOMs were measured and manipulated, while controlling for the subjective balance of individual frequencies of meanings to control for confounding from the relatedness of meaning . For ERP analysis, a non-parametric cluster-based permutation test was employed in addition to the two time windows of interest .ResultsBehavioral results indicated a marginally significant interaction between word frequency and semantic ambiguity along with a main effect of word frequency, showing faster and more accurate responses for high-frequency words. An ambiguity advantage was observed only for low-frequency words, with no significant effect found for high-frequency words. ERP results revealed that lexical-semantic interactions were reflected in the modulations of the N and P components. High-frequency homonyms elicited an enhanced N amplitude, while low-frequency homonyms showed a reduced P amplitude.DiscussionThe findings suggest that the activation of semantic information occurs simultaneously with lexical processing, rather than during post-lexical or decision-making processes. Furthermore, considering balanced homonyms were employed in this study, inhibitory competition may arise from the high-frequency individual meanings of high-frequency words. In contrast, in low-frequency words, a facilitative effect may arise from gains in global semantic activation or semantic feedback to the orthographic level."

In addition to the supportive teacher behaviors of autonomy support, competence support and relatedness support, peer relatedness support is examined as an additional factor.MethodsA total of , students from classes from various German-speaking Swiss cantons took part in the study. The hypothesized four factorial structure was analyzed using multilevel confirmatory factor analyses. Longitudinal measurement invariance testing of intrinsic motivation and perceived competence indicates scalar measurement invariance. Multilevel regression analyses were specified to analysis the longitudinal effects on the development of intrinsic motivation and perceived competence, whereby both the effects of the individual factors as well as the adjusted effects under the inclusion of all predictors were examined.ResultsResults of multilevel confirmatory factor analysis indicate that the hypothesized four-factor model is to be favored over alternative models at both levels. Regarding the prediction of the development of intrinsic motivation and perceived competence our study underlines the predictive value of basic psychological need support. The models that examine the effects of the individual predictors indicate that the effects are largely consistent with expectations at both the class and individual level. At class level, however, autonomy support appears to be no significant predictor for the development of intrinsic motivation , but for perceived competence . Peer relatedness support is a significant predictor for both outcome variables at both levels of analysis. Regarding the simultaneous integration of all predictors, only the effects of peer relatedness support remain significant for both outcome variables.DiscussionThe empirical support of the multidimensionality of the instrument is particularly interesting in the context of the common conceptualization of a unidimensional measurement of autonomy support or a composite factor of psychological need support, whereby only few studies have adequately tested the factorial validity. Although significant effects of supportive teacher behaviors can be demonstrated in the multilevel regression analyses, it is also indicated that the different dimensions lack of incremental predictive validity. Particularly noteworthy is the rarely investigated role of peer relatedness support, which has been shown to be a meaningful predictor, even when supportive teacher behaviors are taken into account."

School SES was measured by the average family SES of all students in the school. SES was categorized as high or low based on one standard deviation above or below the mean. The results showed that when there was a match between family and school SES, adolescents with “Low Family-Low School” SES exhibited more aggressive behaviors compared to those with “High Family-High School” SES. When there was a mismatch between family and school SES, adolescents with “High Family-Low School” SES exhibited higher levels of aggressive behaviors than those with “Low Family-High School” SES. Gender did not moderate these effects. Furthermore, when the parent–child relationship was poor, adolescents exhibited higher levels of aggressive behaviors when family SES exceeded school SES. Conversely, the effects of family and school SES on aggressive behavior were not significant when the parent–child relationship was strong.

These multiple roles also play out in their gesturing, as they sometimes indicate deictically who is the source of the ideas and stances they are expressing . Simultaneous interpreters, though, often work in an interpreting booth; they are often not seen by the audience, yet many of them gesture, sometimes frequently. How are simultaneous interpreters using gesture in relation to stance-taking and footing? We consider the case of simultaneous interpreters rendering popular science lectures between Russian and either English or German . Though only hearing the audio of the lectures, the interpreters produced many gestures, which were analyzed for their function. Some representational and deictic gestures appeared to clearly involve the interpreter as the principal . Other representational and deictic gestures are ambiguous as to whether they are enacting what the interpreter may have imagined what the lecturer did or whether they arose out of the interpreter’s own thinking for speaking . Pragmatic gestures, showing one’s stance toward the topic of the talk, were the most ambiguous as to the footing, reflecting how the interpreter may be engaged in fictive interaction with their imagined audience. Self-adapters, however, more clearly involve the interpreter as the principal, as such actions are known to support cognitive focussing and self-soothing. In sum, we see varying degrees of clarity as to whose stance and principal footing simultaneous interpreters are expressing bodily as laminated speakers. The variable ambiguity can be attributed to the nature of gesture as a semiotic system, the functions of which are more often dependent on co-occurring speech than vice versa."

The experiment manipulated the determiner type, specifically RDP vs. QDP, and grammaticality . The results indicated that similar to previous studies, a P effect was elicited in response to subject–verb agreement violations with omission errors, demonstrating that Chinese L learners are sensitive to such agreement violations. Additionally, the ERP patterns exhibited variations due to D-linking and number specification of RDP and QDP. Regarding D-linking, subject–verb agreement violations in the QDP conditions, necessitating integration of discourse-related knowledge, elicited laterally and frontally distributed P effects associated with integration complexity at the discourse level; however, non-D-linked referential determiners elicited the posteriorly-distributed P effects. Differences in number specification resulted in the distinctive P latencies and whether P was preceded by N or not. While both the RDP and QDP conditions exhibited the P effects, the onset latency of this effect in the number-unspecified RDP condition was ms later compared to the number-specified QDP condition. Furthermore, an additional N component observed in the RDP condition suggests that L learners acquire morphologically complex subject–verb agreements by rote, treating them as unanalyzed chunks. This N component was absent in the QDP condition. From these results, the conclusion can be drawn that L learners are sensitive to the subject–verb agreement violations with omission errors, and L processing patterns of subject–verb agreement vary with different features of determiners, providing further evidence for the cue-based retrieval model during comprehension of grammatical sentences.

We also ask whether individual differences in children’s understanding of mathematical equivalence impacts the effects of gesture- and action-based instruction.MethodAcross two studies, racially and ethnically diverse third and fourth-grade students were given instruction about how to solve mathematical equivalence problems as part of a pretest-training-posttest design. In Study , instruction involved teaching students to produce either actions or gestures. In Study , instruction involved teaching students to produce either actions followed by gestures or gestures followed by actions. Across both studies, speech and gesture produced during pretest explanations were coded and analyzed to measure individual differences in pretest understanding. Children completed written posttests immediately after instruction, as well as the following day, and four weeks later, to assess learning, generalization and retention.ResultsIn Study we find that, regardless of individual differences in pre-test understanding of mathematical equivalence, children learn from both action and gesture, but gesture-based instruction promotes retention better than action-based instruction. In Study we find an influence of individual differences: children who produced relatively few types of problem-solving strategies perform better when they receive action training before gesture training than when they receive gesture training first. In contrast, children who expressed many types of strategies, and thus had a more complex understanding of mathematical equivalence prior to instruction, performed equally with both orders.DiscussionThese results demonstrate that action training, followed by gesture, can be a useful stepping-stone in the initial stages of learning mathematical equivalence, and that gesture training can help learners retain what they learn."

Work ability-limitations were associated with higher demoralization levels. Demoralization was associated with well-being only among participants with high IU. Further, demoralization mediated the relationship between work ability limitations and well-being only for individuals with high IU.ConclusionEncountering limitations among self-employed was associated with demoralization and lower levels of well-being, especially among those with high IU. In addition, demoralization syndrome is prevalent among individuals with CD in general. Early recognition and treatment of demoralization as a treatable psychological syndrome are essential for preventing its degeneration into more complex forms. In addition to uncertainty related to health, it is important to pay special attention to other sources of uncertainty."

During such times, perception of the situation can be important in mediating the link between one’s basic resources and the well-being one attains as an emotional and cognitive response. This study aimed to explore the role of illness impact perceptions in mediating the link between hope, social support and subjective well-being in parents of children with cancer.MethodsThe cross-sectional study included parents of children aged – diagnosed with cancer at least months prior to the study. The parents completed one questionnaire comprising five instruments: perceived impact of illness, hope, social support, positive and negative affect and life satisfaction . Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations were conducted for all study variables. SEM analysis was performed to examine the study’s theoretical model.ResultsThe current sample included parents of children with cancer recruited from two pediatric hematology-oncology wards in two different hospitals in central Israel. Most participants were mothers , and the mean age was .. The main results indicated that hope and social support correlated negatively with perceptions of the illness’ impact. Illness impact perceptions mediated the relations between hope, social support and positive emotions, which means that when the parents perceived their child’s illness as less impactful on the family, they experienced higher levels of emotional well-being.ConclusionA parent with social support resources and higher levels of hope experiences higher levels of positive perceptions regarding their child’s illness. Higher levels of positive perceptions allow the parent to express more positive than negative emotions, thus maintaining a more optimal level of subjective emotional well-being. The findings offer implications for healthcare teams to enhance sensitivity to parents’ needs and to help parents attain more resources, positive perceptions, and well-being."

CSA is a risk factor for the early emergence of borderline personality features, posttraumatic stress, and sexual concerns. Mentalizing, which involves the capacity to understand our reactions and that of others in psychological terms, is a resilience factor for self and interpersonal functioning. The aim of this study was to address knowledge gaps by examining the contributions of CSA and mentalizing in a latent factor composed of borderline personality features, posttraumatic stress, and sexual concerns in a sample of adolescent psychiatric inpatients. We hypothesized that CSA and mentalizing would independently explain the variance in this latent factor.MethodParticipants were adolescents aged – recruited from an adolescent inpatient psychiatric clinic. They completed the Reflective Function Questionnaire for Youth , the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children , and the Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children . CSA was assessed using the Child Attachment Interview , the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children , as well as the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire .Results.% of adolescent psychiatric inpatients reported CSA. CSA and mentalizing were independently associated with a latent factor consisting of posttraumatic stress, borderline personality features, and sexual concerns. CSA explained .% and RF explained .% of the variance of the latent factor. When we consider both the unique and the shared contribution of CSA and mentalizing, the model explained .% of the variance of this factor.DiscussionCSA and mentalizing independently explained variance in a latent factor constituted of borderline personality features, posttraumatic stress, and sexual concerns. The direct effect of mentalizing was stronger and mentalizing explained comparatively more variance of trauma-related symptoms in adolescent psychiatric inpatients. The findings are consistent with the theory that mentalizing is an internal resilience factor in adolescent psychiatric inpatients.

However, whether and how these attributes guide the selection of reference-frames is still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to examine systematically the roles of elongation and symmetry, as well as their combination, in the selection of reference axis and how these axes are developed for unfamiliar objects. We designed our experiments to eliminate two potential confounding factors: extraneous environmental cues, such as edges of the screen, etc. and pre-learned cues for familiar objects and shapes . We used algorithmically generated textures with different orientations having specified levels of symmetry and elongation as the stimuli. In each trial, we presented only one stimulus and asked observers to report if the stimulus was in its original form or a flipped one. Feedback was provided at the end of each trial. Based on previous studies on mental rotation, we hypothesized that the selection of a reference-frame defined by symmetry and/or elongation would be revealed by a linear relationship between reaction-times and the angular-deviation from either the most symmetrical or the most elongated orientation. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. We found that subjects performed mental rotation to transform images to their reference axes and used the most symmetrical or elongated orientation as the reference axis when only one factor was presented, and they used a “winner-take-all” strategy when both factors were presented, with elongation being more dominant than symmetry. We discuss theoretical implications of these findings, in particular in the context of “canonical sensorimotor theory.”"

A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with a planned contrast analysis for the type of video lectures.ResultsWe found that, contrary to the hypotheses, students in the group showed higher social presence scores than students in the groups and . However, no significant differences were found in the cognitive load scores.DiscussionThe results show that VR video lectures with an instructor-only are more effective at enhancing users’ social presence than VR video lectures with both the instructor and class-peers. We suggest creating VR video lectures with the presence of the course instructor to offer learners the sense of actually participating in a lecture."

To address this gap, we developed a novel social media knowledge translation initiative—MisconSEXions—to debunk common myths about sexuality. The goal of this study was twofold. First, to examine whether exposure to MisconSEXions is effective for reducing sexuality myth endorsement. Second, to evaluate the acceptability , appropriateness , adoption , and penetration of MisconSEXions among study participants. We also examined possible group differences in our observed effects by assigned sex, gender modality, and sexual orientation. A large and diverse sample of adults completed an online survey and reported on their demographics, sexuality myth endorsement before and after exposure to MisconSEXions content, and the acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, and penetration of the MisconSEXions content. We found that participants’ sexuality myth endorsement was significantly lower following exposure to MisconSEXions content, and this effect held across assigned sex, gender modality, and sexual orientation groups. Regardless of participants’ assigned sex, gender modality, or sexual orientation, MisconSEXions content was reported to be both acceptable and appropriate to people’s lives. Participants reported relatively low levels of adoption, such that they reported reluctance to engage with the content on social media. Additionally, participants reported mixed feelings regarding the impact of the content on their lives . Overall, the findings have implications for how sexuality social media knowledge translation initiatives can fill important gaps in providing inclusive and accessible sex education."

They completed the Fear of Intimacy Scale , the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire , the Mentalization Scale , and the Integrative Self-Knowledge Scale . To analyze the research data at the descriptive level, frequency, percentage, standard deviation, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used, while path analysis tested our hypotheses in SPSS version and AMOS version . Fit indices were used to check the model’s fit, and the mediation test was performed using the bootstrapping method. The fit indices revealed an excellent fit of the model with the data .ResultsResults indicate mentalization fully mediates the childhood trauma-fear of intimacy relationship . However, the indirect relationship between childhood trauma and fear of intimacy through integrative self-knowledge was insignificant. The results also showed that the path coefficient from mentalization to fear of intimacy was negative and significant , while the path coefficient from integrative self-knowledge to fear of intimacy was not significant .DiscussionBased on the current findings indicating the complete mediation of mentalization and the insignificance of the mediation of integrative self-knowledge, we can deduce that enhancing the capacity for mentalization holds promise in effectively addressing intimacy-related issues. Overall, the study suggests mentalization effectively predicts the relationship between childhood trauma and fear of intimacy.

This study developed a penalty task based on real soccer match scenarios and recruited experienced soccer referees. These referees were divided into two groups, high anxiety and low anxiety, based on their anxiety levels, to perform decision-making tasks under different pressure environments simulated to mimic real matches. Additionally, this research employed Event-Related Potential technology to compare the brain signals of soccer referees with different levels of anxiety when facing foul play under various pressure environments. It was found that referees with high levels of anxiety displayed larger P and N amplitudes in a low-pressure environment . However, no significant differences in P and N amplitudes were observed between referees with high and low levels of anxiety under high-pressure conditions . This study not only reveals the complex mechanisms of anxiety in the decision-making process of referees but also emphasizes the importance of understanding and managing the psychological state of referees in competitive sports to improve the quality of their decisions.

Numerous studies have identified and clarified the effects and prevalence of alcohol use across different contexts. However, when it comes to the prevalence of alcohol in psychiatry and its impact on treatment outcomes compared to other patient groups, studies are relatively scarce, and results often vary, sometimes with different outcomes. This study focuses on investigating the effectiveness of psychological treatment in psychiatric clinics for outpatients, considering those with and without hazardous alcohol use under naturalistic conditions.MethodsPatients were recruited between and from psychiatric clinics in Sormland, Sweden, as part of the regular services. Patients completed symptom assessment instruments regarding depression, anxiety, quality-of-life, and alcohol consumption at the beginning of their psychological treatment, upon completion, and during a follow-up year after completion. Completion of questionnaires was ongoing for some patients until . A total of patients were included in the study, distributed among participating therapists.ResultsAmong all patients in the study, .% showed hazardous alcohol use at the start of their psychological treatment, with a higher proportion being men. There was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with hazardous use and a notable decrease in the mean audit score upon completion of psychological treatment. At follow-up, there was no significant change compared to completion. There were .% of the patients who achieved recovery or improvement in the audit score upon completion of treatment. Patients with hazardous alcohol use consistently scored higher mean values on the symptom assessment instruments and lower on the quality-of-life instrument at the beginning. More individuals with hazardous alcohol use typically achieved better results across all outcome instruments at both at completion and follow-up.ConclusionPatients with hazardous alcohol use demonstrate significant improvements in their alcohol consumption through standard psychological treatment in psychiatry, despite the treatment not specifically focusing on alcohol consumption. The progress/improvement appears to be largely maintained at follow-up. Moreover, patients with hazardous alcohol use tend to show greater progress across all outcome instruments. No significant gender differences were detected in this context."

Earlier studies, however, revealed a “dark side” of work engagement showing negative effects such as more work-family conflict. Using a resource perspective, our study seeks to better understand why and when these negative effects of work engagement occur. Specifically, we test a new model in which the relationship of work engagement with work-family conflict is mediated by organizational citizenship behavior and work rumination. Moreover, we argue that employees’ resource-building strategies and resource levels buffer resource depletion due to high work engagement.MethodsWe tested our assumptions in a field study that involved data collected on three measurement points with employees from Nigeria. The measures consist of Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale, Work Rumination Scale, Psychological Capital Scale, Job Crafting Measure, Work-family Conflict Scale, and demographic variables. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypotheses.Results and discussionResults from latent structure equation modelling confirm that work rumination mediates the positive relationship between work engagement and work-family conflict. Additionally, our findings suggest that behavioral engagement and work rumination mediate the relationship between work engagement and work-family conflict. Moreover, psychological capital mitigated the relationships of work engagement with work rumination, but not job crafting.

Taking mainland China, dominated by heteronomativity, as a field, this paper focuses on the visibility negotiation and social accessibility practices in Blued-based queering code/space. Using the digital anthropology method, this study found that Blued-based visibility is essential for non-closeted gay men to gain a sense of local belonging and community inclusion. Offline accessibility is a crucial demand for Blued users, but until then they have negotiated visibility through selective disclosure of social cues. At the same time, Blued users face visibility asymmetries and risks in the pursuit of accessibility.

Additionally, we explore whether these effects are limited to the group most clearly targeted, or if they “spill over” to other minoritized communities.MethodsTo study reactions to hate crimes, we draw upon national survey data in combination with a natural experiment involving the Unite the Right rally and vehicle attack in Charlottesville, Virginia in August . We employ an “unexpected event during survey” design to estimate the causal effect of the Charlottesville rally on stress about hate crimes.ResultsWe first show that there was an increase in anti-Black hate crimes in the weeks following the Charlottesville incident. We also find a corresponding increase in stress due to the perception of personal vulnerability to hate crimes among African-Americans. However, we do not observe a significant increase in levels of stress following the trigger event among Hispanics and Asian Americans.DiscussionOur results suggest that highly publicized instances of intergroup violence can have significant impacts on stress about hate crime victimization within the target group.

Digitalization is defined as the incorporation of digital technologies into various aspects of work life, fundamentally transforming processes, interactions, and decision-making.AimThe present research focuses on the mediating roles of job-related risk and personal risk, and the moderating effect of gender. We hypothesized that employees’ aversion to risks, both in their professional and personal facets, mediates the relationship between the rapid digitalization of their work environment and the resultant job stress. Regarding gender as a moderator, recent research suggests that gender can influence the experience of workplace stress, with women often experiencing higher levels of stress than men in certain situations. This indicates that gender might also moderate the relationship between digital living, risk perception, and job-related stress. This approach allows for an examination of the ways in which digital technology adoption influences workplace stress, considering the temporally spaced data.MethodsConducted over three waves of data collection among Chinese employees, the research utilizes Hayes’s Model , adept at revealing the dynamics of digitalization’s influence in the workplace and its effects on individual well-being.ResultsThe study corroborates Hypothesis by establishing a significant, albeit less pronounced, relationship between digital living and job stress. The findings also support Hypothesis by demonstrating that both job risk and personal risk mediate this relationship.

However, persuasive effects were only observed in the first study, and an injunctive majority appeal increased persuasive outcomes, but there were no differences between the descriptive conditions and no differences in their impact depending on individuals’ environment related dispositions in either study.DiscussionA single exposure may be insufficient to exert persuasive effects and the change in perceived social norms may first need to be internalized. In online explainer videos, the effects of social norm appeals could be amplified by algorithm-based suggestions and when social norm appeals draw attention to norm-conforming content. However, further research is required on the long-term effects and their possible amplification via social media."

The present study explored the immediate and long-term effects of a positive psychology intervention course, Study with Strength, on the well-being of students at general upper secondary school in Finland during the pandemic. Based on a partly randomized wait-list control group design, the study included a final sample of students from schools. Self-report measures were used to assess both immediate between-group effects and long-term within-group effects of the intervention on student well-and ill-being. A combination of methods from positive psychology and cognitive therapy were applied, and the course was administered by the participating schools’ own teachers and student-welfare personnel. The findings show that the Study with Strength intervention course enhanced the students’ experiences of positive practices at school, happiness and of positive emotions. However, the effect sizes were small. The intervention did not have any immediate effects on all aspects of well-being, negative emotions, depression, or study-related burnout. The significant, positive changes in students’ well-being in the analysis of long-term effects must be interpreted with caution. The students also reported a positive effect of the intervention both on their personal lives and in their studies.

In it, Piklerian choreographies were found in observed educators’ behavior during the studied three daily activities: feeding breakfast, dressing to go to the garden and free play accompanying. All of them share certain Piklerian principles, which are synthesized in three central keys: the stability of the educator’s behavior, her strategic and intentional positioning, and an active emotional control.ObjectivesThis study aims to contrast this synthesis of results by means of an in-depth interview with the two observed educators, and to apply the methodological approach of indirect observation within mixed methods for its analysis. The objective is to confirm whether the three central keys are recognized as their own and to look for new theoretical-practical elements within the studied educational approach.Materials and methodsWe applied an in-depth interview and analyzed it following the guidelines of indirect observation. The participants were the two educators previously observed, a translator from the Pikler team, and the three observers, authors of this work. An ad hoc observation instrument was elaborated, and the three macro-stages QUAL-QUAL-QUAL proposed within mixed methods were rigorously followed.ResultsLag sequential analysis was used to conduct data analyses. We deepened in prospective lags and obtained the response pattern underlying the interview. Then, we performed a concurrence analysis to investigate the relationship between the central keys obtained in our original research and Piklerian ideas.ConclusionIn-depth interview within mixed methods has been a novel and generous tool leading us to substantial and methodological contributions, despite the simplicity of performed analyses. Interviewed educators’ response pattern is a faithful reflection of the Piklerian modus operandi. The study of concurrences shows that Piklerian education is something natural, integrated in its professionals, with the exception of emotional control, which still requires permanent reflection."

We focused on two types of action: actions that promote social change and actions that encourage retribution.MethodsWe investigated these processes within the #MeToo social movement using data collected in Australia and Romania . In both samples, we measured antecedents of ’group consciousness’ and its indicators . As indicators of intragroup fragmentation, we measured endorsement of different categories of group behaviors such as pro-social change action versus pro-retribution action. To assess the predictive power of motivations for joining the movement and of group consciousness for either pro-social or retributive actions, we tested several structural equation models .ResultsOur results indicate that the motivations for joining such social movements were more complex than anticipated, with perspective-taking emerging as a significant differentiator. Our analyses further show that different dimensions of group consciousness could predict support for either pro-social or retributive actions.DiscussionThese findings highlight the complexity of the intragroup processes in newly emerging, modern social movements such as #MeToo. Our findings have implications for the study of membership dynamics in social movements and suggest that strategies to mobilise support should be tailored to these complexities.

The scope of the research is to investigate martial artists’ level of resilience and aggression , what is specific to athletes and who have suffered from moderate and/or severe injuries , and test the possibility that a psychological variable under investigation can predict athletes’ injury severity.Materials and methodsA total sample of athletes from striking combat sports—SC , grappling combat sports—GC , and mixed martial artists participated in the research. For assessing resilience, the Romanian adaptation of the Brief Resilience Scale was used, and for aggression, the Romanian adaptation of Makarowski’s Sports Aggression Questionnaire was used. An injury report form was also created and applied to athletes.ResultsThe post-hoc tests revealed significant differences for resilience and Foul play between the sports disciplines analyzed. A significant positive correlation was found between athletes’ injury severity and assertiveness in SC and between injury severity and resilience in GC. Through the t-test for independent samples, it was highlighted that the average value for Foul play is significantly higher in athletes who have suffered mild, moderate, and/or severe injuries compared with martial arts athletes who have suffered from only mild/minor injuries. A binomial logistic regression was also performed to verify to what extent Foul play predicts athletes’ injury severity.ConclusionA low level of Foul play is linked with a decreased likelihood of moderate and/or severe injuries in martial arts athletes.

All participants had competed nationally or internationally and had . years of athletic experience. Data were collected during competitions and training sessions for weeks. The participants completed the Brunel Mood Scale, Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, Brief Self-Control Scale, and Visual Analogical Scale of Perceived Stress before each session. The components of run-up variability of successful and failed attempts were measured using video analysis. Data were analyzed using a t-test, Pearson’s correlation, and Cohen’s d.ResultsAthletes specializing in long jump and triple jump displayed similar psychological and run-up variability characteristics. However, females showed higher values for tension and depression, whereas males had higher run-up speeds and vigor. In competitions, athletes tended to have higher vigor, lower fatigue and confusion, an earlier beginning of the adjustment phase, fewer failed attempts, and higher run-up speed than during training. Emotional regulation is inversely related to depression in women during competitions, whereas higher self-control is associated with fewer failed jumps.ConclusionAthletes competing in the long jump and the triple jump do not differ in psychological traits and run-up characteristics, which suggests that similar training strategies can be used in both events. However, different solutions should be used considering the sex of athletes, with a particular focus on utilizing emotion regulation tools to modulate depression in female jumpers. It is recommended to include training sessions that simulate competition demands, primarily to ensure the early onset of the run-up adjustment phase."

However, the evidence regarding age differences in metacognitive skills is rather mixed, with some evidence pointing toward further refinement and development and other evidence suggesting declining levels. Academic motivation, an important antecedent of metacognitive self-regulation, has also been reported to decline steeply in adolescence. Hence, this raises the question whether there are any age-related differences in academic motivation and metacognitive self-regulation of adolescents and whether age differences in academic motivation drive decreases in metacognitive self-regulation.MethodA large sample size of , Greek adolescents was utilized in the present study. Multigroup measurement invariance analyses were deployed to compare the latent means of motivational factors and metacognitive self-regulation across age groups. Cholesky decomposition was applied to test the independent contribution of motivational factors to and the indirect effects of age on metacognitive self-regulation.ResultsInvariance analyses revealed scalar invariance for metacognitive self-regulation, language self-efficacy, mastery and performance goal orientations and partially scalar invariance for task value. Older adolescents scored lower on metacognitive self-regulation, mastery and performance goals, and self-efficacy. Older students scored lower on metacognitive self-regulation via indirect effects through Cholesky decomposed motivational factors.DiscussionSelf-efficacy, mastery and performance goals, and task value are similarly understood across adolescents in different age groups.

Despite the obvious importance of leadership as a determinant of many important outcomes, the concept of leadership has been surprisingly hard to pin down, lacking consensus as to its precise meaning. As numerous authors introduce ever more constructs , the leadership concept has become emblematic of the problem of construct proliferation. Like the related fields of employee engagement, subjective well-being, and organizational culture, the leadership field is in desperate need of a clearly articulated meta-theory to house its many constructs, allowing theory and measurement to build up instead of continuing to pile up. This paper argues for grounding the concept of leadership within the psychological literature on human needs. In reviewing the leading definitions of leadership in the literature we find that they are reducible to a core set of follower needs that can be facilitated or inhibited by leaders. We propose that there is substantial value in adopting a comprehensive needs-based taxonomy over current approaches. We consider the impact of setting the concepts of leadership within existing need constructs for each of the following: theory, especially the development of leadership frameworks and particularly how the concept of leadership relates to the concepts of organizational culture, employee well-being, and employee engagement; methods, including the value of applying a comprehensive, structured model; and practice, where we emphasize the practical advantages of clear operational definitions."

This study aims to explore the diverse clinical profiles of metacognition among patients with EDs using latent profile analysis .MethodA total of patients with a DSM- diagnosis of ED participated in this study. They completed self-report measures assessing metacognition, eating psychopathology, depression, emotional dysregulation, personality traits, and childhood adversities. LPA and Welch ANOVAs were conducted to identify profiles based on metacognition scores and examine psychological differences between them. Logistic regression models were employed to explore associations between personal characteristics and different profiles.ResultsA -class solution had a good fit to the data, revealing profiles of high functioning , intermediate functioning , and low functioning based on levels of metacognitive impairments. Participants in the IF group were older and had a higher BMI than those in the HF and LF groups. Individuals with BN were largely categorized into HF and LF profiles, whereas participants with BED were mainly included in the IF profile. Participants in the LF group reported an impaired psychological profile, with high levels of depression, emotional dysregulation, childhood adversity, and personality dysfunction. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed significant associations between metacognitive profiles and emotional and neglect abuse, emotion dysregulation, and detachment.ConclusionThis exploratory study unveils distinct metacognitive profiles in EDs, providing a foundation for future research and targeted interventions. In this light, metacognitive interpersonal therapy could be a valid and effective treatment for EDs, as suggested by the initial promising results for these patients."

According to Gottfredson’s Career Construction theory , young people - influenced by their need for social approval - have already narrowed down their spectrum of acceptable occupations by the time they participate in school-based career orientation programs. Therefore, we focus on career guidance interventions that take into account their need for social approval. We present first results of an intervention study of a newly developed approval-sensitive workshop, “Logic of Career Choice.” It challenges students’ mostly unconscious need for social approval, raising awareness and prompting reflection and action on this aspect of their career choices. By analyzing a sample based on a quasi-experimental treatment-control group research design, we examine to what extent this workshop can contribute to reaching its objectives [n = students in secondary schools; treatment group ; control group ]. Confirmatory factor analyses indicate the reliability of the new measurement instruments. The six examined constructs include the relevance of social approval, the feeling of autonomy, interest in career choice, reflection of needs, intention to act, and reported career choice activities. The results reveal partial confirmation of hypothesis regarding the importance of social approval and the feeling of autonomy. However, the constructs reflection of needs and intention to act show parallel developments in both the treatment and control groups, leading to the rejection of these hypotheses. The constructs interest in career choice and retrospectively reported activities regarding career choice show unexpected effects of the workshop. Interest in career choice decreases significantly more in the treatment group than in the control group, and the treatment group reports significantly more retrospective career choice activities. The discussion interprets the results in the context of their scientific and practical implications, with special attention given to the decrease in interest in career choice in the treatment group and the increased retrospective reporting of career choice activities."

Specifically, we investigate the underlying psychological mechanisms contributing to the prevalence of positive self-views among individuals with European backgrounds, characterized by individualism, versus those with East Asian backgrounds, associated with collectivism. Our study compares Europeans and East Asians in Canada to determine whether cultural norms regarding positive emotions account for the elevated positive self-views and subjective well-being in Europeans. With a sample of participants , our findings reveal significant indirect effects of culture on subjective well-being through positive emotion norms and positive illusions. This study highlights that Europeans, compared to East Asians, believe it is more appropriate to experience and express positive emotions, and this norm influences their positive self-views, subsequently impacting subjective well-being. These findings offer valuable insights into how cultural factors shape subjective well-being across different groups."

From minor consequences like social discontent to severe outcomes such as economic damage through tax evasion, dishonest behavior affects us in multiple ways. This study investigates whether gender and psychological traits contribute to dishonest behavior, and whether unethical conduct is stable across diverse tasks. We examined participants using a “Difference Spotting Task” and two motor tasks . Dishonesty was measured by comparing self-reported performance with actual performance, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of both occurrence and extent of dishonesty. Our findings indicate that gender does not significantly influence the occurrence or extent of dishonest behavior. Moreover, we discovered that “Social Desirability” positively influences the extent of dishonesty, while “Task Orientation” increases the likelihood of engaging in dishonest acts. The study also reveals that the level of dishonesty remains relatively stable across all three tasks at an intrapersonal level."

Their composition, comprising a heterogeneous mix of professionals, contributes to a more comprehensive service, but also poses challenges. Consequently, scholarly interest has arisen in comprehending how these compositions, known as faultlines, influence team dynamics and outcomes. However, there is a lack of comprehensive exploration into how faultlines influence team members’ communication processes and knowledge sharing. This study aims to provide insights into the associations between faultlines in primary care teams and team performance, specifically exploring how knowledge sharing may mediate these effects, with the goal of revealing key insights to optimize contracted family doctor services. Survey data from family doctor teams in China was utilized to test hypotheses, revealing a negative association between faultlines and knowledge sharing. Team knowledge sharing acts as a mediator in the relationship between these faultlines and team performance.

The study measured DSC, altruism, BJW, and GLS.ResultsThe findings revealed a significant positive predictive effect of DSC on college students’ altruism and belief in a just world . Notably, GLS emerged as a multi-mediating factor in this relationship. The study also revealed that both subscales of BJW, namely personal belief in a just world and general belief in a just world , played distinct roles in the mediation model. PBJW exhibited a stronger mediating effect, suggesting that DSC can foster individual altruism and BJW. Particularly, BJW was identified as enhancing GLS, subsequently promoting altruistic behavior.ConclusionThis study contributes to the existing literature on social comparison by shedding light on the relationship between DSC, altruism, and the mediating role of belief in a just world and GLS.

However, individual characteristics should be considered when communicating difficult information. We conducted a multicentric study to explore the moderating role of coping styles on the relationship between information about cancer, quality of life and psychological distress.MethodsIn the period between October and February , patients with a diagnosis of a solid tumor were recruited from seven Italian oncology units. All participants were administered the Distress Thermometer , the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer , the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire , and the EORTC QLQ -item information module . We explored the moderating effect of coping style with quality of life and distress as dependent variables and information on cancer treatment as independent variable.ResultsLow levels of anxious preoccupation significantly moderated the relationship between information on treatment and QoL , while low and medium levels of hopelessness significantly moderated the relationship between information on treatment and DT .

However, the consensus definition emphasizes that misophonia entails much more than that. Even in cases of subclinical misophonia, where individuals do not meet the disorder criteria, the experience can still be burdensome, despite not currently causing significant distress or impairment. The S-Five is a psychometric tool for comprehensive assessment of five aspects of misophonic experience: internalizing, externalizing, impact, threat, and outburst, and includes S-Five-T section to evaluate feelings evoked by triggering sounds and their intensity. We examined whether the five-factor structure developed in the UK could be replicated in a Polish sample, including individuals with and without self-identified misophonia. The Polish version of the S-Five was translated and tested on Polish-speaking individuals. Comprehensive psychometric evaluation, including factor structure, measurement invariance, test–retest reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity evaluations, was conducted on the translated scale. Exploratory factor analysis suggested similar structure to the original English study, while bootstrap exploratory graph analysis showed the factor structure to be reproducible in other samples. The scale was found to be bias free with respect to gender, internally consistent and stable in time, and evidence of validity was provided using MisoQuest and Misophonia Questionnaire. These results offer support for the cross-cultural stability of the five factors and provide preliminary evidence for the suitability of the Polish version for clinical and research purposes. The study also investigated five facets of misophonia, triggering sounds, emotional responses, and their associations with symptoms of psychopathology across various cultures. It underscores the central role of anger, distress, and panic, while also highlighting the mixed role of irritation and disgust in misophonia across different cultural contexts. Mouth sounds evoked the most pronounced reactions compared to other repetitive sounds, although there were discernible cultural differences in the nature and intensity of reactions to various trigger sounds. These findings hold significant implications for future research and underscore the importance of considering cultural nuances in both research and the clinical management of misophonia."

The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate how students’ defending and pro-aggressive bystander behaviors evolved over the course of one school year and their association to basic moral sensitivity, moral disengagement, and defender self-efficacy. Three-hundred-fifty-three upper elementary school students each completed self-report surveys at three points during one school year. Results from latent growth curve models showed that pro-aggressive bystander behavior remained stable over the year, whereas defending behavior decreased. Moreover, students who exhibited greater basic moral sensitivity were both less likely to be pro-aggressive and simultaneously more likely to defend. Students with defender self-efficacy were not only associated with more defending behavior at baseline but also were also less likely to decrease in defender behavior over time. Conversely, students reporting a higher degree of moral disengagement were linked to more pro-aggressive behavior, particularly when also reporting lower basic moral sensitivity. These short-term longitudinal results add important insight into the change in bystander behavior over time and how it relates to students’ sense of morality. The results also highlight the practical necessity for schools to nurture students’ sense of morality and prosocial behavior in their efforts to curb peer victimization."

People can gain emotional experiences in music and can also regulate their own emotions through music. Music has its own structural rules, and exploring the relationship between musical structure and emotions is an important approach to understanding the mechanism of music-induced emotions. Musical mode refers to the arrangement of intervals around the tonic, presenting different musical modes based on the central tone and the arrangement of intervals, including Chinese pentatonic modes and Western major and minor modes. Musical morphology indicates significant differences in the construction intensity of traditional Chinese pentatonic modes and major and minor modes, affecting their mode forms and thus determining their adaptability to external influences.AimsExploring the modalities of music and the effects of individual music training experiences on emotion induction; validating whether musical modes exhibit cross-cultural universality in the process of emotion induction.MethodThis study recruited university students as participants . Through a passive listening paradigm using the GEMS and combined with a biofeedback equipment, it explored the differences in behavioral and physiological indicators of emotional experiences influenced by the modal forms of Chinese traditional pentatonic modes and Western major and minor modes.ResultsFirstly, the arousal level of music emotion is a primary factor influencing individuals’ aesthetic emotional experiences in music, which is related to the intensity of modal construction in music; Secondly, the emotional pleasure and skin temperature change induced by pentatonic music are greater than those induced by major and minor modes; Thirdly, the arousal level, electrodermal change, and heart rate variability of major and minor modes are greater than those of pentatonic music; Finally, music training experience enhances college students’ familiarity and preference for pentatonic music, thereby strengthening the electrodermal physiological indicators of emotional experiences.ConclusionThe different modal forms of music express different levels of emotional arousal, leading to differences in individuals’ emotional dimensions and physiological indicators in music. Additionally, individuals’ music training experiences and cultural backgrounds also influence their experience of music emotions."

This experimental study investigates whether inducing dyad members to enact constructive preparation activities can promote deep learning from subsequent collaboration while examining prior knowledge as moderator. In a digital collaborative learning environment, non-expert university students assigned to dyads studied a text about the human circulatory system and then prepared individually for collaboration according to their experimental conditions: the preparation tasks varied across dyads with respect to their generativity, that is, the degree to which they required the learners to enact constructive activities . After externalizing their answer to the task, learners in all conditions inspected their partner's externalization and then jointly discussed their text understanding via chat. Results showed that more rather than less generative tasks fostered constructive preparation but not interactive collaboration activities or deep comprehension outcomes. Moderated mediation analyses considering actor and partner effects indicated the indirect effects of constructive preparation activities on deep comprehension outcomes via interactive activities to depend on prior knowledge: when own prior knowledge was relatively low, self-performed but not partner-performed constructive preparation activities were beneficial. When own prior knowledge was relatively high, partner-performed constructive preparation activities were conducive while one's own were ineffective or even detrimental. Given these differential effects, suggestions are made for optimizing the instructional design around generative preparation tasks to streamline the effectiveness of constructive preparation activities for deep learning from digital collaboration."

In response to the COVID- pandemic, wearing a face mask in public became mandatory in many countries, hindering social information perception and emotion recognition. Given the importance of visual communication for children’s social-emotional development, concerns have been raised on whether face masks could impair their ability to recognize emotions and thereby possibly impact their social-emotional development.MethodsTo this extent, a quasiexperimental study was designed with a two-fold objective: firstly, to identify children’s accuracy in recognizing basic emotions and emotional neutrality when presented with faces under two conditions: one with no-masks and another with faces partially covered by various types of masks ; secondly, to explore any correlation between children’s emotion recognition accuracy and their affective state. Sixty-nine elementary school students aged - years old from Greece were recruited for this purpose. Following specific requirements of the second phase of the experiment students were assigned to one of three distinct affective condition groups: Group A-Happiness, Group B-Sadness, and Group C-Emotional Neutrality. Image stimuli were drawn from the FACES Dataset, and students’ affective state was registered using the self-reporting emotions-registration tool, AffectLecture app.ResultsThe study’s findings indicate that children can accurately recognize emotions even with masks, although recognizing disgust is more challenging. Additionally, following both positive and negative affective state priming promoted systematic inaccuracies in emotion recognition. Most significantly, results showed a negative bias for children in negative affective state and a positive bias for those in positive affective state.DiscussionChildren’s affective state significantly influenced their emotion recognition abilities; sad affective states led to lower recognition overall and a bias toward recognizing sad expressions, while happy affective states resulted in a positive bias, improving recognition of happiness, and affecting how emotional neutrality and sadness were actually perceived. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the intriguing dynamics of how face masks affect children’s emotion recognition, but also underlines the profound influence of their affective state."

In the last decades, a growing interest has been developed around socially shared regulation of emotions and how it is interwoven with self-regulation and co-regulation. However, capturing the process of students’ emotional challenges and regulations in a long and dynamic project proves difficult and there remains a paucity of evidence on how co-regulation and socially-shared regulation co-occur with learners’ cognitive and emotional progress in project-based collaborative learning. The purpose of the present study is to investigate and identify what kind of social emotional challenges students encountered during PBCL and how they regulate themselves and the groups in order to finish the projects. A quasi-experimental research design was adopted in an academic English classroom, with thirty-eight students self-reporting their challenges and regulations three times after finishing each of the projects. The results of qualitative analysis plus a case study of two groups indicate that students encounter a variety of social emotional challenges and employed different levels of co-regulation and socially shared regulation in addition to self-regulation, leading to varying collaboration results and experiences. The findings of the study offer insights into the emotional regulation in PBCL and shed light for future design of pedagogical interventions aiming at supporting socially shared regulation."

However, psychological motivation is complex and campaigns need to be based on an understanding for what individual, and contextual, factors support or hinder sustainable behavioral choices.MethodsIn a discrete choice experiment, participants made hypothetical online purchases in each of three rooms designed to evoke associations to hedonic, gain, and normative goal frames. Participants were shown a campaign message intended to prime sustainable textile consumption prior to the purchase. For each product hedonic , gain , and normative attributes were varied in an online choice experiment.ResultsPreferences for the normative attribute of t-shirts increased in the normative room compared to the room with gain associations. No effect of the rooms with hedonic or gain priming was observed on the choice.DiscussionThe study supports the hypothesis that the physical room can enhance goal frame activation and behavioral choice but concludes that such priming effect is sensitive to specificity of the prime."

Despite its perceived importance, there is ongoing debate and insufficient clarity about how exactly placeness influences people’s behavior. This study aims to bridge this gap by theorizing and investigating the pathways from placeness to people’s behavioral intentions, emphasizing the roles of personal place attachment and public place image as pivotal mediators in this relationship. To explore these dynamics, we conducted a survey in Japan, examining the complex interplay between placeness and behavioral intentions, given their rich cultural heritage and modern urban pressures. We employed the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling approach for path analysis. The analysis suggests that placeness influences behavioral intention through personal place attachment. While placeness does affect public place image, this public image does not have an impact on behavioral intention. The results demonstrated that an individual’s activities, experiences, and cognition of a place are significant factors in creating the intention to engage in word-of-mouth, recommendation, and revisiting behaviors. Policymakers, urban planners, and designers need to understand how to foster people’s behavioral intentions when creating a place imbued with placeness."

We investigated how this development occurs in - to -year-old children by examining two complex musical skills . Accordingly, we developed a child-focused approach to understand the underlying developmental processes of tonality and consonance preferences in - to -year-old children using a video interview format. As previous studies have confounded preference with perception, we examined each concept separately and measured perceptual abilities as categorization. For tonality, the ability to categorize tonal and atonal melodies developed by the age of years. It is noteworthy that only children who could categorize successfully showed a preference for tonality at the age of . For consonance, we observed an early preference for consonance at years of age, but this preference was only measurable with large differences between consonant and dissonant stimuli.

Based on the observation that infants sometimes show rhythmic motor responses when listening to auditory rhythms, the present study asked whether specific rhythm cues would systematically increase infants’ spontaneous rhythmic body movement, and whether their rhythmic movements would be associated with their speech processing abilities. We used pre-existing experimental and video data of German-learning .- and .-month-old infants tested on their use of rhythm as a cue for speech segmentation. The infants were familiarized with an artificial language featuring syllables alternating in pitch, intensity, duration, or none of these cues. Subsequently, they were tested on their recognition of bisyllables based on perceived rhythm. We annotated infants’ rhythmic movements in the videos, analyzed whether the rhythmic moving durations depended on the perceived rhythmic cue, and correlated them with the speech segmentation performance. The result was that infants’ motor engagement was highest when they heard a duration-based speech rhythm. Moreover, we found an association of the quantity of infants’ rhythmic motor responses and speech segmentation. However, contrary to the predictions, infants who exhibited fewer rhythmic movements showed a more mature performance in speech segmentation. In sum, the present study provides initial exploratory evidence that infants’ spontaneous rhythmic body movements while listening to rhythmic speech are systematic, and may be linked with their language processing. Moreover, the results highlight the need for considering infants’ spontaneous rhythmic body movements as a source of individual differences in infant auditory and speech perception."

Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that students’ self-efficacy at the beginning of the term positively predicted their final grades. However, logistic mixed modeling revealed that students who held stronger beliefs about writing as a means of exploring and expressing ideas had lower odds of passing. Our findings contribute to the understanding of international students’ motivation in academic English settings in higher education and offers potential pedagogical interventions to enhance their academic success."

However, existing studies have paid less attention to the low-carbon behavior of college students. Based on the theory of planned behavior, this paper constructs a theoretical model of influencing factors of college students’ low-carbon behavior. Combined with questionnaires from Chinese colleges and universities, this study uses a structural equation model and multi-group analysis method to explore the motivation of college students’ low-carbon behavior and guiding education strategies. The results show that low-carbon attitude, subjective norms, low-carbon values, and perceived behavior control have significant positive effects on low low-carbon behavior intention of college students, and influence their low-carbon behavior through low-carbon behavior intention. Further research found that gender and growth environment presented heterogeneity in different influence paths, and the perceived cost had a significant negative moderating effect during the transition from low-carbon intention to low-carbon behavior. These research findings provide a theoretical basis and policy inspiration for explaining and guiding the low-carbon behavior of college students."

Thus, the current research investigated how the presence of observers who can see and listen to -year-old children’s judgments but who do not present their opinions influences children’s conformity in moral judgment behavior. In Experiment , the children were presented with pictures depicting prosocial behaviors and asked whether the behaviors were acceptable. The children’s tendency to change their answers after hearing the counterintuitive opinions of informants was then measured. The results showed that the children’s moral judgments were more likely to conform to that of the group in the presence of observers. Experiment aimed to determine the reason children were more likely to conform to a group when being watched by observers in Experiment . Children were randomly assigned to two conditions with different observer conditions as follows. Observers were either wearing headsets, indicating that they could not hear the children’s responses, or had them hanging around their necks, indicating that they could. The results showed that children’s conformity behavior depended on whether observers could hear what they were saying. The current findings are expected to help elucidate not only social factors that affect children’s moral judgments but also the developmental mechanism of an observer effect."

Empirical evidence has revealed that cyberbullying increases when public crises occur, that such behavior is gendered, and that social media user account verification may deter it. However, the association of gender and verification status with cyberbullying is underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by examining how Weibo users’ gender, verification status, and expression of affect and anger in posts influence cyberbullying attitudes. Specifically, it investigates how these factors differ between posts pro- and anti-cyberbullying of COVID- cases during the pandemic.MethodsThis study utilized social role theory, the Barlett and Gentile Cyberbullying Model, and general strain theory as theoretical frameworks. We applied text classification techniques to identify pro-cyberbullying and anti-cyberbullying posts on Weibo. Subsequently, we used a standardized mean difference method to compare the emotional content of these posts. Our analysis focused on the prevalence of affective and anger-related expressions, particularly examining variations across gender and verification status of the users.ResultsOur text classification identified distinct pro-cyberbullying and anti-cyberbullying posts. The standardized mean difference analysis revealed that pro-cyberbullying posts contained significantly more emotional content compared to anti-cyberbullying posts.

Some variants of the Finger Tapping Test may reveal cognitive aspects associated with frontal processing, including executive functions such as inhibition, or emotional aspects such as anxiety. A context of particular interest for the application of cognitive-motor-anxiety interactions is sports. Although athletes generally exhibit better anxiety levels, they may experience heightened anxiety before important competitions. The problem lies in determining whether the application of anxiety control techniques can be useful in pre-competition situations, given the lack of quick and easy methods to detect if an athlete is experiencing anxiety at a particular moment.MethodsThis exploratory study evaluated anxiety using online versions of questionnaires and applied a variant of the FTT to participants, both athletes and non-athletes. The scores were compared and correlated.ResultsAthletes exhibited lower general anxiety and greater cognitive resistance to interference . Non-athletes displayed a particular parameter in the FTT variant that differed from the one obtained by athletes and exhibited higher anxiety levels. In the athletes’ group only, anxiety was correlated with a specific parameter of the FTT task.DiscussionOur conclusion is that this parameter holds potential relevance in elite sports performance to detect if an athlete is experiencing anxiety.

The university context is conducive to this type of research, as it includes situations that favor instances of violence. Additionally, it aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Gender Equality and Quality Educations.Design/methodology/approachThis paper follows a qualitative and interpretative approach. This choice was due to the need to know the “how” and “why” elements that are part of violence against women in the university context. As the main source of evidence for the study, we conducted in-depth interviews with women and men , all university students involved in situations of violence. The transcription of the interviews generated quotations, including analysis codes.FindingsAfter conducting the data coding, we identified that the actions and omissions of the educational institution, the taste for violence, the perception of self-efficacy and the influence of the aggressors’ group of friends, and the apparent dichotomy between women’s vulnerability and women’s strength are among the main antecedents of violence against women.

Monolateral and no stimulation served as control conditions. Noise-induced startle reflex response and galvanic skin response were used for physiological responses and the valence and arousal scale of the Self-Assessment-Manikin for subjective responses.ResultsBoth groups showed a subjective distress reduction for unpleasant scripts and a subjective attention increase for positive scripts under bilateral stimulation. In healthy individuals, this was also for physiological measures, and a general startle-reducing effect of bilateral stimulation in the absence of affective stimuli was found. In PTSD patients, however, the effects were restricted on the subjective level, and no concomitant physiological effects were observed.Conclusions and significanceThe findings indicate, that generalizing the effects of BLS in healthy individuals to PTSD patients may be problematic.

However, such action inhibition may be profoundly influenced by affective states. Interestingly, research indicates that action control can be either impaired or improved by emotional stimuli. Thus, a great deal of confusion surrounds our knowledge of the complex dynamics subtending emotions and action control. Here, we aimed to investigate whether negative stimuli, even when non-consciously presented and task-irrelevant, can affect action control relative to neutral stimuli. Additionally, we tested whether individual differences in intracortical excitability may predict action control capabilities. To address these issues, we asked participants to complete a modified version of the Stop Signal Task in which fearful or neutral stimuli were subliminally presented before the go signals as primes. Moreover, we assessed participants’ resting-state corticospinal excitability, short intracortical inhibition , and intracortical facilitation . Results demonstrated better action control capabilities when fearful stimuli were subliminally presented and interindividual SICI predicted stronger action inhibition capabilities.

The collective behavior of a community could make a significant contribution. This paper presents the results of a field experiment designed to promote packaging waste prevention – called precycling – in a newly formed community setting, in Berlin, Germany. The aim was to examine the effect of the intervention on precycling and to examine the underlying social identity processes. Over a four-week period, participants from different households digitally received a combination of different interventions, that were theoretically informed by the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action . Households were assigned to two intervention groups and a waiting control group. Data was collected before, immediately after and four months after the intervention to assess the impact of the intervention using multilevel models. After the intervention, the overall precycling behavior increased significantly, but not as a result of the different group conditions. In the more comprehensive intervention group, which included social interaction and behavioral experimentation, the community identification was strengthened and the reuse behavior, as a subset of precycling, increased. While a number of social identity processes were found to positively predict the precycling behavior, surprisingly, the predictive power of social norms and ingroup identification could not be confirmed. Overall, the presented community intervention promoted precycling. However, in this dynamic real-world setting, not all intervention elements worked as expected. The pitfalls and opportunities of this intervention are discussed, and ideas for translating the results into everyday precycling activities are presented."

Therefore, this study evaluated a novel intervention approach by testing the effectiveness of two online interventions based on the study demands-resources framework. These interventions aimed to balance demands and resources. Derived from the theoretical assumptions of the framework, we hypothesized that the interventions would increase study and personal resources, engagement, and study crafting, and decrease study demands, exhaustion, and self-undermining. Additionally, we hypothesized that demands and resources would mediate the effects of the intervention on engagement, exhaustion, study crafting, and self-undermining.MethodsConducted as a randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group , the study involved participants in two intervention groups who engaged with the interventions for weeks. Intervention group focused on adapting demands, while intervention group focused on increasing resources. The design allowed for a comparison of the effectiveness of these different approaches.

In this new normal, encouraging the public to implement proper personal protective behaviors against the coronavirus disease is vital to the sustainable development of cities and communities. This knowledge–attitude–practice survey conducted in Chengdu narrowed the knowledge gap regarding post-pandemic public practices of protective behavior. Findings show that: approximately / of the respondents are currently not concerned about COVID- at all; respondents with different demographics and individual COVID--related factors showed significant differences in practice behaviors indoors and outdoors; vulnerable groups performed better in practice behavior indoors/outdoors; because the public may relax their vigilance outdoors, public places may become a transmission threat in the next outbreak; attitudes are important, but limited incentives for practice; and when knowledge increases beyond a threshold , protective behaviors decrease. Our results suggest that authorities must continue to educate and motivate the public, extending measures to cover personal protective practices, and have targeted policies for specific demographics to ensure equity in healthcare in the event of another pandemic . Besides, comparing the results of the current study with similar studies conducted in other parts of the world can provide insights into how different populations respond to and adopt COVID- protective behaviors.

Additionally, few qualitative studies explored the transition to parenthood from both dyadic perspectives.AimTo explore the first-time transition to parenthood experience among mothers and fathers in mainland China during pregnancy, and compare the similarities and differences between their experiences in this transition period.MethodsA descriptive qualitative study was conducted with parents, including primiparous women and their husbands. Data were analyzed by directed content analysis guided by the Transition Shock Model. The interview texts were first analyzed at individual levels and subsequently at the couple level to identify dyadic themes.ResultsFive themes and thirteen sub-themes emerged from the data analysis, including role integration, health risk, dilemma of preparation, protective isolation, and multi-dimensional expectation. Unexpectedly, the experiences and perspectives of mothers and fathers regarding the transition to parenthood were found to be similar, with the exception of the sub-theme extra-care requirement.ConclusionThe findings shed light on the complex emotional journey and expectations of parents, as well as the challenges they face in terms of physical well-being, limited coping resources, and restricted social connections. Notably, fathers in China often shared the stress of the whole process during the transition period alongside mothers but often lacked accessible avenues for seeking and receiving support.

The survey instruments included the Physical Activity Rating Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Simple Coping Style Scale, and Depression-Anxiety Stress Scale. The data were statistically analyzed using multivariate methods with IBM SPSS . and the PROCESS V. plug-in.Results College students engage in a low level of physical activity, with male students participating significantly more than female students . Physical activity was significantly positively correlated with psychological resilience and positive coping styles and overall negative correlated with negative emotions in college students . Psychological resilience and positive coping styles were found to play a chain mediating role between physical activity and negative emotions. The mediation effect consists of two paths: physical activity → psychological resilience → negative emotions , and physical activity → psychological resilience → positive coping → negative emotions . Female students demonstrated higher levels of positive coping , while male students exhibited more negative emotions .ConclusionOur study identifies a significant indirect link, mediated by psychological resilience and positive coping styles, between physical activity and the reduction of negative emotions. Targeted interventions addressing gender differences, such as offering special courses and providing specialized exercise programs and emotional management strategies, can enhance psychological resilience and positive coping mechanisms.

However, conflicting results have arisen, possibly due to varying approaches and methodologies across studies. These discrepancies might also arise from inadequate consideration of individual differences in emotionality. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the moderating effect of healthy emotionality on the relationship between emotion and memory of criminal events. The results of our laboratory experiment conducted with VR technology indicate that eyewitnesses of crimes, unlike observers of neutral events, recall details concerning the perpetrators’ actions immediately preceding the crime act better. Notably, individuals with lower scores on a scale measuring healthy emotionality demonstrate enhanced recollection for these details. At the same time, emotionality plays no significant role in recollection in repeated measurement, as well as in remembering the neutral event. The emotions experienced during crime observation appear to hinder the recollection of perpetrator appearance and behavior unrelated to the crime.

Although such movements are known to affect the meter and pulse perception of complex auditory rhythms, no studies have investigated their contribution to the performance of sensorimotor synchronization . In the present study, participants listened to syncopated auditory rhythms and flexed their dominant hand index finger in time with the perceived pulses . In the first experiment , the participants moved their heads via voluntary neck flexion to the pulses in parallel with finger SMS . This performance was compared with finger SMS without nodding . In the second experiment , we investigated the specificity of the effect of head SMS on finger SMS confirmed in Exp. by asking participants to flex their bilateral index fingers to the pulses . We compared the performance of dominant hand finger SMS between the BM and ND conditions. In Exp. , we found that dominant hand finger SMS was significantly more stable in the ND versus WN condition . In Exp. , dominant hand finger SMS was significantly more accurate in the ND versus BM condition . In addition, the stability of dominant hand finger SMS was significantly correlated with the index of phase locking between the pulses and head SMS across participants in the ND condition . In contrast, the stability of dominant hand finger SMS was not significantly correlated with the index of phase locking between pulses and non-dominant hand finger SMS in the BM condition . These findings suggest that SMS modulation depends on the motor effectors simultaneously involved in synchronization: simultaneous head SMS stabilizes the timing of dominant hand finger SMS, while simultaneous non-dominant hand finger SMS deteriorates the timing accuracy of dominant hand finger SMS. The present study emphasizes the unique and crucial role of head movements in rhythmic behavior."

The participant pool comprises students , including non-native speakers , representing a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. The Top-RAN dataset encompasses performance, error, and self-correction metrics for each subtest and student, underscoring the significance of these factors in the process of reading acquisition. Analytical methods include dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification algorithms, consolidated into a Python package to facilitate reproducible results. Our results indicate that visuospatial reading abilities vary according to the task and demonstrate a marked evolution over time, as seen in the progressive decrease in execution times, errors, and self-corrections. This pattern supports the hypothesis that the growth of oculomotor, attentional, and executive skills is primarily fostered by educational experiences and maturation.

Research with adults suggests that intuition often favors cooperation, but these effects are contextually sensitive. Emerging evidence has shown that in many contexts children show a tendency toward intuitive cooperation, but research investigating these processes in children is sparse and has produced mixed findings. In the current study we investigated the influence of intuitive and reflective decision processes on children’s fairness behavior by manipulating decision time. We tested pairs of children between and years of age from a rural community in Canada. Children’s decisions to accept or reject allocations of candies were either made under time pressure or after a -s delay. We assessed the impact of decision time on children’s aversion to inequitable distributions of resources by comparing their responses to equal allocations with either disadvantageous allocations or advantageous allocations. We found that children showed a greater age-related increase in advantageous inequity aversion when decisions were made under time pressure compared to when they were made after a delay. In contrast, we did not observe a significant impact of decision time on the development of disadvantageous inequity aversion.

Adults with professionally diagnosed autism or high levels of subclinical autistic traits consistently show greater tendencies to anthropomorphize, which has been hypothesized to reflect ) a compensatory mechanism for lack of social connectedness and ) a persistence of childhood anthropomorphism into adulthood. Here, we directly tested these hypotheses in a general population sample consisting of both adults and early adolescents using the refined -item Anthropomorphism Questionnaire , which measures both present and childhood anthropomorphic tendencies. We found that adults with heightened autistic traits reported increased present anthropomorphism , which held even after controlling for social connectedness. In contrast, adolescents with heightened autistic traits did not show increased present anthropomorphism, but rather reported reduced childhood anthropomorphism after controlling for social connectedness. We also found evidence that the present and childhood subscales of the AnthQ may tap into fundamentally different aspects of anthropomorphism. The results suggest that increased anthropomorphic tendencies in adults with heightened autistic traits cannot be explained solely by increased sociality motivation, but may be due to delayed development of anthropomorphism, although alternative possibilities of measurement problems cannot be ruled out. Implications for the measurement of anthropomorphism and its relation with theory of mind were also discussed."

The effects of word frequency in turns-at-talk, the nucleus of social action in conversation, have, by contrast, been largely neglected. This study probes into this gap by applying corpus-linguistic methods on the conversational component of the British National Corpus and the Freiburg Multimodal Interaction Corpus . The latter includes continuous pupil size measures of participants of the recorded conversations, allowing for a systematic investigation of patterns in the contained speech and language on the one hand and their relation to concurrent processing costs they may incur in speakers and recipients on the other hand. We test a first hypothesis in this vein, analyzing whether word frequency distributions within turns-at-talk are correlated with interlocutors' processing effort during the production and reception of these turns. Turns are found to generally show a regular distribution pattern of word frequency, with highly frequent words in turn-initial positions, mid-range frequency words in turn-medial positions, and low-frequency words in turn-final positions. Speakers' pupil size is found to tend to increase during the course of a turn at talk, reaching a climax toward the turn end. Notably, the observed decrease in word frequency within turns is inversely correlated with the observed increase in pupil size in speakers, but not in recipients, with steeper decreases in word frequency going along with steeper increases in pupil size in speakers. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of speech processing, turn structure, and information packaging. Crucially, we propose that the intensification of processing effort in speakers during a turn at talk is owed to an informational climax, which entails a progression from high-frequency, low-information words through intermediate levels to low-frequency, high-information words. At least in English conversation, interlocutors seem to make use of this pattern as one way to achieve efficiency in conversational interaction, creating a regularly recurring distribution of processing load across speaking turns, which aids smooth turn transitions, content prediction, and effective information transfer."

It employs images depicting people going through different situations involving all the senses, showing expressions related to positive and negative emotions, and realizing varied activities. Forty-five participants visited the esplanade in the exterior of a historic building called Obispado. The case study is located on a hill and is a scenic viewpoint of Monterrey, Mexico. The participants answered the RADES and the Environmental Description Survey , which focuses on describing the qualities of the place and the appraisals with which it is experienced. The comments about the experiences of the place obtained through both surveys were grouped into categories. Qualitative and quantitative data about the experiences of the place were obtained through both techniques. A quantitative analysis of the data was realized since the participants not only described their experiences with words but also indicated numerically the intensity of such experiences. Spearman correlations between the experiences were calculated, and a general map of the experiences of the place was created through multidimensional scaling analysis . The study revealed the connections between the elements and qualities of the site and the views with specific positive and negative experiences occurring during the visit.

Not only language and digital competences, but critical-thinking and problem-solving skills are needed. Moreover, well developed socio-affective abilities, empathy among them, are also key when dealing with others. This is even more relevant when teachers are to work with a non-mainstream population, such as adult migrants with low literacy levels, and to design student-centered curricula or activities. Empathy is a multifaceted process involving, among others, perception, intellection, affect and other sensory aspects of the lived experience. It has been argued that the first-person perspective-taking involved in empathic engagement must necessarily involve rational computation and cognitively mediated processing. Training future teachers in the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies is a means to integrate multimodal digital instruction and aggregate cognitive as well as socio-emotional features to the education of future language teachers.MethodA mixed-method pre-post study was conducted with trainee teachers who participated in stand-alone digital multiliteracy interventions, in which they were encouraged to envisage themselves as future teachers of low-literate migrants. Policy documents such as the reference guide on Literacy and Second Language Learning for the Linguistic Integration of Adult Migrants, journal articles, audiovisual resources as well as examples of existing educational materials aimed at the target audience, were made available to them on an online platform. In two separate studies, trainees were encouraged to collaboratively produce two different multimodal outputs. The Revised Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy was administered before and after the intervention, subjecting the data obtained to quantitative analysis. Qualitative data was also collected to gain a better understanding of the affective and cognitive processes experienced by the participants.ResultsSimple statistical analysis coupled with the comparison of means was used to respond to the research questions. Statistical hypothesis testing, including correlations and non-parametric statistics were used to analyze the relationship between each of the factors within the RSEE and the participants, considering the different interventions applied. Non-parametric tests were used to compare the differences between the levels of ethnocultural empathy of the participants in the two studies. Significant differences were found in Factor and Factor between the groups and their post-intervention results, with a p value of . and ., respectively. The effect size r was calculated, obtaining a size effect of . for Factor and . for Factor . These results indicate that the significant differences and the size effect between both groups are large. U-Mann Whitney non-parametric analysis also revealed gender differences in Factor , showing females higher levels than males. Effect size r analysis showed a large size effect of . for Factor . The findings pertaining to gender-related differences in empathy levels confirm the conclusions drawn by previous studies. When contrasting study and , statistical differences were also shown after the intervention for the ‘Anxiety and Lack of Multicultural Self-efficacy’ factor. The qualitative data analysis was carried out with Atlas.ti v., in order to isolate and categorize the broader themes and the most significant explanatory quotes extracted from the participants’ records and interviews. The results reveal the learning strategies that each group of learners applied to successfully complete the task at hand, as well as the participants’ deployment of their critical thinking skills and the awakening of a sense of awareness of their own professional competence development process.ConclusionThis study set out to compare how effective two digital multiliteracy interventions were in developing future language teachers’ ethnocultural empathy and cognitive abilities when appraising the educational needs of low-literacy migrants. Despite the small sample size, the study certainly adds to our understanding of the impact of multimodal tasks involving critical thinking skills on trainees’ cognitive and affective abilities. Besides, it expands the growing body of research that points to the desirability of embedding digitally-based content creation tasks in training curricula for future language teachers."

The training program developed aimed at equipping clinicians, particularly inexperienced with technology, to effectively utilize an electronic PROM system for collecting systematic patient information. Our study is set in the context of the Mental Health Services in Denmark, focusing on a specialized clinic for treating trauma-affected refugees. The multidisciplinary team involved in this project reflects a wide range of healthcare professionals. The training program employed a variety of activities over nearly years, adapting to feedback and aiming to engage clinicians in continuous improvement processes. Analyzing qualitative data with thematic analysis we interpreted that the training’s extended focus on discussion of the implementation process, with limited hands-on experience, potentially reinforced clinicians’ hesitations toward new technology, rather than reducing them. Clinicians prioritized immediate concerns over potential long-term benefits. Despite this, their approach reflects a strong commitment to patient welfare and careful evaluation of new practices.

To explicate this inconsistency, the current study examined the associations among PTSS, resilience, and patterns of emotional-approach coping. A sample of male combat veterans filled out questionnaires on trauma exposure, PTSS, depressive symptoms, resilience, and emotional-approach coping. Their data were analyzed using structural equation modeling path analysis. Participants reported high exposure to potentially traumatic events during service. Mean scores were high for resilience and relatively low for PTSS and depressive symptoms; % had a clinical level of posttraumatic stress disorder. Structural equation modeling revealed that emotional-approach coping strategies mediated the relationship between resilience and PTSS. However, emotional expression was associated with lower PTSS levels, whereas emotional processing was associated with higher PTSS levels. These results suggest that although emotional-approach coping was related to higher resilience, emotional expression might have a more positive effect than self-oriented emotional coping strategies. Providing veterans with supportive opportunities and a wider repertoire of emotional coping skills might enhance their well-being, reduce postservice emotional distress while not harming veterans’ resilience levels."

Data were analyzed using the Framework Method.ResultsWe identified four distinct yet interconnected phases in the need restoration process: Discrepancies between Actual and Desired Need States, Experiencing Negative Emotions, Initiating Plans for Action, and Action Stage. These stages offer a comprehensive framework for understanding how individuals restore their needs.DiscussionWe discerned contrasting approaches to need restoration depending on prior experiences of need frustration due to external contingencies versus need frustration due to internal factors and need unfulfillment. Need frustration due to external contingencies prompts withdrawal, aligning with the avoidance strategies identified in the literature. Conversely, unfulfilled needs and need frustration due to internal factors lead to proactive engagement, highlighting a distinct ‘fight’ response. These insights extend existing research, providing a nuanced understanding of the dynamic processes of need restoration."

The normal developmental trajectory of long-term memory, in this case, memory recall after week, and the influence of cognitive variables such as intelligence have not extensively been described, which is a drawback for the use of accelerated long-term forgetting measures in pediatric neuropsychology.MethodsIn this clinical observation study, we analyzed the normal developmental trajectory of verbal memory recall after week in healthy children and adolescents. We hypothesized that -week recall and -week forgetting would be age-dependent and correlate with other cognitive functions such as intelligence and working memory. Sixty-three healthy participants between the ages of and years completed a newly developed auditory verbal learning test and the WISC-V intelligence test . Using these tests, week recall and week forgetting have been studied in relation to GAI, verbal learning performance, and verbal working memory.ResultsNeither -week recall nor -week forgetting seems to be age-dependent. They are also not significantly predicted by other cognitive functions such as GAI or working memory. Instead, the ability to recall a previously memorized word list after days seems to depend solely on the initial learning capacity.ConclusionIn the clinical setting, this finding can help interpret difficulties in free recall after days or more since they can probably not be attributed to young age or low intelligence."

,2024,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1238780/full,"Observed choices between options representing a relative vice and a relative virtue have commonly been used as a measure of eating self-control in the literature. However, even though self-control operations may manifest across the post-choice consumption stage, either similarly or in different ways from the choice stage, most prior research has ignored consumption quantity of the chosen option. While the behavior of choosing a virtue instead of a vice does manifest self-control, we examine how this plays out in post-choice consumption. Specifically, we find that when processing resources are limited, after having chosen a virtue food, unrestrained eaters ironically consumed greater quantities and therefore more calories than restrained eaters . This reflects more persistent self-control in the post-choice consumption stage among restrained eaters than unrestrained eaters, and occurs because choosing a virtue lowers accessibility of the self-control goal among unrestrained eaters relative to restrained eaters , thereby increasing intake of the virtuous food. In contrast, subsequent to having chosen a vice, unrestrained eaters and restrained eaters did not show any such difference in intake or goal accessibility . Together, these results reveal that persistence of self-control in the post-choice consumption stage depends on individuals’ dietary restraint and their initial exercise of self-control in the choice decision. The mere act of choosing a virtue satisfies unrestrained eaters’ self-control goal and leads to increased food intake, whereas the same act keeps the same goal activated among restrained eaters who reduce intake of the chosen virtue. Put differently, persistent self-control across choice and quantity decisions is observed only when those with a dietary goal show successful self-control enactment in the choice stage. We therefore highlight that the operation of self-control can be dynamic within a consumption episode, and thus, choice and post-choice quantity are both informative of self-control."

It was created according to the following criteria: a flexible qualitative approach, the production and relational reading of information, intersubjective measurability and control of the inferential/interpretative process, and clinical use. Although it is organized in a structured and well-defined form and provides a precise system for encoding information, it is not a test, nor an algorithm that can be used in a mechanically diagnostic sense; it is a very versatile psychological tool that can be used in two different areas: the first is related to clinical research on family and couple relationships, the second to relational assessments. The contribution illustrates the path of construction and elaboration of the instrument, considering first of all its theoretical foundations and the constructs derived from them and around which the set of items is organized. The criteria for coding and analyzing the information thus produced and the different possible areas of application are then described. Finally, the theoretical and methodological characteristics of the instrument are also considered in relation to the main interviews in the literature in order to highlight differential particularities."

To explore whether child cognitive level, conduct problems and the need of language interpretation in contacts between parents and professionals are associated with patterns of parenting stress and support.MethodParents of children with disabilities in Sweden completed a questionnaire about parenting stress and support. Patterns of three variables—parenting stress and access to sufficient informal and formal support—were investigated using cluster analysis. The relationship of child cognitive level, level of conduct problems and of language interpretation needs between parents and professionals to cluster membership was explored using multinomial logistic regression.ResultsFive different clusters of parenting stress and support emerged. Parents in cluster had lower than sample mean ratings on all three variables. Cluster had elevated parenting stress, cluster had elevated insufficient informal support and cluster had elevated insufficient formal support. Cluster had elevated ratings on all three variables. Greater child cognitive difficulties increased the likelihood of parent membership in cluster , cluster , or cluster . Child conduct problems increased the likelihood of membership in cluster or cluster . No relationship between language interpretation needs and cluster membership was found.ConclusionsPatterns of parenting stress and sufficiency of support, and their associations with child characteristics, vary substantially. However, families of children with conduct problems experiencing elevated parenting stress in combination with insufficient informal and formal support, may be particularly vulnerable. The results of the current study highlight the clinical importance of exploring and identifying individual parenting stressors and perceived levels of support, to be able to adapt services to better suit a variety of needs, and thus promote equitable care."

Behavioral tasks such as the Iowa Gambling Task provide a means to measure the learning process involved in decision-making. To comprehend this process, three hypotheses have emerged: participants prioritize gains over losses, they exhibit insensitivity to losses, and the capacity of operational storage or working memory comes into play. A dynamic model was developed to examine these hypotheses, simulating sensitivity to gains and losses. The Linear Operator model served as the learning rule, wherein net gains depend on the ratio of gains to losses, weighted by the sensitivity to both. The study further proposes a comparison between the performance of simulated agents and that of substance abusers and control adults . The findings indicate that as the memory factor increases, along with high sensitivity to losses and low sensitivity to gains, agents prefer advantageous alternatives, particularly those with a lower frequency of punishments. Conversely, when sensitivity to gains increases and the memory factor decreases, agents prefer disadvantageous alternatives, especially those that result in larger losses. Human participants confirmed the agents’ performance, particularly when contrasting optimal and sub-optimal outcomes. In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of evaluating the parameters of the linear operator model across diverse clinical and community samples."

This can shed light on the challenges and strategies employed in alleviating prejudiced attitudes against immigrants’ languages and cultures which can cause alienation from the roots in the one-and-a-half and second generation. The research questions were: How has the war altered language policies in families with different ethnic backgrounds? What changes in home language use strategies do parents propose?Material and methodsMaterial drawn from numerous posts of Facebook discussions have been analyzed with the help of thematic analysis.Results and discussionWe observe that in many multilingual families with Ukrainian roots the war has led to a greater emphasis on the Ukrainian language use as an attempt to reinforce ties to their cultural heritage and express support for the country. Russian is increasingly viewed as the language of the aggressor; moreover, Russian culture is devalued and rejected. Some families have become more open to new language learning, especially the languages of their new environment, and try to identify themselves as multicultural and multiethnic personalities. On the other hand, in those families where parents work or study in the fields in which Russian is widely used, adults prioritize the development of Russian language skills in their children in order to improve their future educational and professional opportunities.

Although role-play is widely used as a psychotherapeutic technique, its mechanisms of action are not fully understood.MethodsOur study introduces a standardized controlled procedure for promoting role-play in the laboratory based on the portrayal of a fictional persona and examines its effects on anxiety, affect, prosocial attitudes, and salivary oxytocin dynamics in participants.ResultsIn our experiment, role-play significantly increased positive affect and prosocial attitudes and decreased anxiety compared to a control condition. Basal salivary oxytocin levels predicted higher gains in positive affect following role-play, suggesting a specific moderating effect of oxytocin. The fictional persona used in the procedure was rated as very happy by subjects, creating a positive social context for the role-play social interaction.DiscussionsWe propose that the observed moderation effect of oxytocin in our study is specific to the role-play condition due to the capacity of role-play to generate an affective regulatory context based on congruency toward the emotional state of the fictional persona. Our findings indicate that basal oxytocin levels could predict specific outcomes of role-play in therapeutical setting. We discuss several psychological and biological mechanisms that could account for the observed effects of role-play and how oxytocin could act as a substrate for them."

This article examines the evaluation of gender inequalities – real and symbolic – in the consumption of social networks such as YouTube and Instagram among young people. Within the framework of a Research &amp; Development &amp; innovation project, it presents a discursive-theoretical analysis of how young users of social media perceive the presence and representation of gender on social media and whether such digital representations can be associated with an empowering gender perspective. This study presents results from focus groups , composed of students aged to , drawn from three Spanish Autonomous Communities . The results show that gender issues arise in participants’ conversations, especially among female participants, who perceive the importance of physical appearance on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Female participants feel more pressure in terms of appearance and dress compared to male participants. Among male participants there are more expressions of self-affirmation and more mentions related to fun and social prestige. Both male and female participants express concern about the impact of that pressure on younger girls. The influence of social media on self-image is more evident among female participants, who make frequent mention of the importance of self-esteem in relation to beauty standards and exposure to idealized body images. Notably, there were no comments by male participants that acknowledge any influence of social media on their self-image. The findings are in line with existing research and taken as a whole gives rise to concern as to the gender disparities observed in the use of social media, which do not constitute a picture of female empowerment. This research underlines the importance of promoting a respectful and equitable environment in relation to gender equality within digital spaces. Thus, this study provides support for the need to develop and implement edu-communicative initiatives to foster critical thinking around the influence of social media in this context and the evaluation of the impact of such initiatives in future research."

The development of a nation’s soft power frequently hinges on cultural communication and the promotion of language. This manuscript concentrates on Japan as a case study and undertakes an investigation of the methods it has employed to cultivate its soft power. To accomplish this objective, Japan’s strategies for cultural communication and the promotion of the Japanese language are comprehensively examined. From the perspective of language planning, prestige planning of language and culture constitutes a crucial mode of cultural communication, whereas language education planning is the primary method of language promotion. Japan has adeptly disseminated its culture overseas through cultural communication and language promotion. On one hand, it fashions a “cool culture” embodied by anime and manga to augment cultural appeal and amplify national image. On the other hand, it advances the Japanese language abroad by establishing supportive institutions, dispatching experts and volunteers, and creating online teaching materials. Building on Japan, this paper establishes a theoretical framework for the construction of soft power, employing the aforementioned two approaches as valuable guides for research on soft power."

Current contexts of child development assessment require pragmatic assessment instruments that accurately define profiles and take into account the immediate context in which they develop. Parents' knowledge of their children's abilities is supported by exhaustive observation over time of regularities in their behavior. But it is true that the way a caregiver interprets behavior is mediated by multiple variables. The aim of the present study, therefore, is to shed light on the possible influence of parental belief systems on the assessment of children's pragmatic development by analyzing the relationship between sociofamilial variables and the assessment of pragmatic competence.MethodA total of educational centers across Spain participated in the study. The final sample was of parents of boys and girls between and months of age. The parental questionnaire for the evaluation of pragmatic development, The Pragmatics Profile, in an adapted Spanish version, was applied along with a number of items for the evaluation of parental beliefs.ResultsAnalyses confirm the existence of an effect of child development conceptions and other socio-familial variables on the assessment of pragmatic development between and months of age. Furthermore, the results indicate that better scores on pragmatic development are associated with parents with higher socioeconomic and educational levels, greater number of children and more interactionist conceptions and realistic.ConclusionThe effect of parental conceptions on the evaluation of pragmatics points to the need to obtain convergent measures in an area as complex as that of communicative development in early childhood, especially taking into account that an evaluation which is neutral and free from context is not possible or indeed desirable. Pragmatic development must be evaluated within this contextual framework and should take into account each of the variables present therein. Hence the complementarity between parental reports and performance-based test."

Multiple factors contribute to the severity of the vitiligo disease burden, among which the most important are self-esteem, stress, and stigma. We aimed to measure the importance of health-related life quality in assessing disease burden in patients with vitiligo. We formulated an HA, which is the principal hypothesis, claiming a single fundamental factor that characterizes the life quality of patients with vitiligo. We also formulated important research questions related to the quality of life that can be generally formulated for patients with dermatological illnesses but particularly suited for vitiligo patients. These research questions capture fundamental aspects of the health-related quality of life of vitiligo patients influenced by symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, job and education, personal relationships, and treatment. These also cover specific aspects related to the quality of life, such as skin-caused sexual difficulties, difficulties in social relationships, and difficulties in performing sports, among others. The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire measures the health-related quality of life of persons suffering from skin diseases. We applied this generic questionnaire to patients with vitiligo. Following a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, we obtained carefully selected patients who responded to all the questions. This study also validated the DLQI questionnaire on persons who suffer from vitiligo. We investigated whether DLQI has acceptable internal consistency by applying Cronbach's alpha internal consistency indicator . The obtained Cα = . indicates excellent internal consistency. We also examined whether all the questions in the questionnaire were mathematically consistent, which we finally proved. It was not necessary to remove any of the questionnaire questions. To prove our HA, a Principal Axis Factoring was applied, verifying the assumptions regarding the Average Variance Extracted and Convergent Validity . HA proved that applying PAF on DLQI resulted in extracting a single general vitiligo latent factor of life quality, with an initial eigenvalue = ., SS loadings = ., and % of the total cumulative variance explained. Diverse statistical analyses were applied to analyze the formulated research questions. The results of the analysis of the research questions are presented and discussed in the manuscript. One of the conclusions related to the analysis of a research question was that sex had the lowest correlation with the latent life quality factor identified for vitiligo patients."

We extended this type of investigation to two other important communicative signals, i.e., partner-directed gaze and iconic co-speech hand gestures with the aim of determining if the adaptations made by older adults differ from younger adults across communication conditions. We recruited pairs of participants, comprising primary talkers and secondary ones. Primary talkers consisted of three groups: older adults with mild Hearing Loss ; older adults with Normal Hearing ; and younger adults. The DiapixUK “spot the difference” conversation-based task was used to elicit conversions in participant pairs. One easy and three difficult communication conditions were tested. The three conditions consisted of two in which the primary talker could hear clearly, but the secondary talkers could not, due to multi-talker babble noise or a less familiar hearing loss simulation , and a condition in which both the primary and secondary talkers heard each other in babble noise . For primary talkers, we measured mean number of partner-directed gazes; mean total gaze duration; and the mean number of co-speech hand gestures. We found a robust effects of communication condition that interacted with participant group. Effects of age were found for both gaze and gesture in BAB, i.e., older adult-NH looked and gestured less than younger adults did when the secondary talker experienced babble noise. For hearing status, a difference in gaze between older adult-NH and older adult-HL was found for the BAB condition; for gesture this difference was significant in all three difficult communication conditions . We propose the age effect may be due to a decline in older adult’s attention to cues signaling how well a conversation is progressing. To explain the hearing status effect, we suggest that older adult’s attentional decline is offset by hearing loss because these participants have learned to pay greater attention to visual cues for understanding speech."

The study employs a grounded theory approach to actively develop concepts in the MHPSS field in Norway. The six selected Norwegian expert teachers can make up a so-called “unique case”, representing a high-income country with a robust welfare system and child-centered pedagogy. Yet, they reveal challenges in embracing the concept of psychosocial support: The analysis shows that the teachers seem to neglect and even reject the concept of psychosocial support, while also expressing inferiority and lack of agency towards other professions. However, the teachers also express the desire for more knowledge, and with proudness they energetically engage in fostering children’s agency and functioning by their everyday descriptions of «meeting with the child».

Drawing upon the self-determination theory, our research comprehensively investigated external and internal factors contributing to dropout. Among external factors, competing extracurricular commitments, music theory and solfége lessons, and teacher’s approach emerge as the most prominent. Among internal factors, our findings highlighted the critical role of autonomy, competency, and relatedness in shaping students’ decisions to continue or discontinue music education. Inadequate teacher-student relationships, limited peer interactions, and uninspiring classroom atmospheres significantly impacted dropout. Moreover, challenges in the music school curriculum, such as difficulties with music theory and solfège, resource limitations, and excessive workloads, emerged as prominent barriers to student engagement. By addressing these multifaceted issues, our study underscores the importance of fostering supportive environments that cater to individual needs and interests, ultimately enhancing the overall music education experience and reducing dropout rates.

At the same time, long-term familiarity with an accent is also known to yield stable perceptual benefits. However, whether the long-term effects reflect sustained, cumulative progression from shorter-term adaptation remains unknown. To fill this gap, we developed a web-based, repeated exposure-test paradigm. In this paradigm, short test blocks alternate with exposure blocks, and this exposure-test sequence is repeated multiple times. This design allows for the testing of adaptive speech perception both within the first moments of encountering an unfamiliar accent and over longer time scales such as days and weeks. In addition, we used a Bayesian ideal observer approach to select natural speech stimuli that increase the statistical power to detect adaptation. The current report presents results from a first application of this paradigm, investigating changes in the recognition accuracy of Mandarin-accented speech by native English listeners over five sessions spanning weeks. We found that the recognition of an accent feature improved steadily over the three-week period. Unexpectedly, however, the improvement was seen with or without exposure to the accent.

In today’s workplace, where change and innovation are increasingly a fact of life, too many transitions end in failure, at a high cost to both people and organizations. Interest in the identity work integral to career transition has grown rapidly in recent years and it is now recognized that career transition is more than simply a change in status, salary and role description. It involves social, relational and personal shifts, conscious and unconscious processes, and identity work—agentic, holistic engagement in the shaping and sustaining of who we become. Evidence suggests that specifically addressing identity work in coaching leaders, teams and groups significantly increases the success rate of transitions. And yet topics around identity and identity work are given little prominence in coaching education, leaving many coaches unaware of these basic constructs. This paper presents a new coaching framework, the MAP coaching model, to support coaches and their clients as they embark on the process of identity work in voluntary career choices and transitions.

We asked a two-fold research question: What makes a virtual ball interceptable or not? How reliably can individuals perceive this affordance for oneself? We hypothesized that a spatiotemporal boundary would determine the interceptability of a ball, and that individuals would be able to perceive this boundary and make accurate perceptual judgments regarding their own interceptability. To test our hypotheses, we administered a manual lateral interception task to subjects. They were first trained on the task, which was followed by two experimental sessions: action and judging. In the former, participants were instructed to intercept as many virtual balls as possible using a hand-held slider to control an on-screen paddle. In the latter session, while making interceptions, participants were instructed to call “no” as soon as they perceived a ball to be uninterceptable. Using generalized linear modeling on the data, we found a handful of factors that best characterized the affordance of interceptability. As hypothesized, distance to be covered and ball flight time shaped the boundary between interceptable and uninterceptable balls. Surprisingly, the angle of approach of the ball also co-determined interceptability. Altogether, these variables characterized the actualized interceptability. Secondly, participants accurately perceived their own ability to intercept balls on over % of trials, thus supporting our hypothesis on perceived interceptability. Analyses revealed that participants considered this action boundary while making their perceptual judgments.

This study uses qualitative and quantitative data from daily diary entries and daily self-assessments during inpatient treatment. The aim of the study is to get an insight into the similarities and differences between both types of data and how they represent self-organized pattern transitions in psychotherapy. While a complete correlation of results is not expected, we anticipate observing amplifying and subsidiary patterns from both perspectives.Materials and methodsDaily, five MDD patients wrote diaries and completed self-assessments using the Therapy Process Questionnaire, a questionnaire for monitoring the change dynamics of psychotherapy. The data were collected using the Synergetic Navigation System, an online tool for real-time monitoring. Diary entries of the patients described their experiences in everyday life. The qualitative text analysis was conducted using Mixed Grounded Theory, which provided categories representing the patients’ ongoing experiences of transformation and stagnation. The time series data was analyzed using the dynamic complexity algorithm and the pattern transition detection algorithm. Results from qualitative and quantitative analyses were combined and compared. Following the process of data triangulation, the leading perspective came from the theory of self-organization. In addition to presenting the overall results for all five patients, we delve into two specific case examples in greater detail.ResultsSpecific and highly diversified diary entries of patients were classified into the categories of perceived pattern stability, noticing improvement, broadening the perspective, critical instability, and experiencing moments of Kairos. Patients reported problems not only related to their disorder but also to phases and steps of change, which could be related to the theory of self-organization . Qualitative and quantitative analysis provide important supplementary results without being redundant or identical.ConclusionData triangulation allows for a comprehensive and multi-perspective understanding of therapeutic change dynamics. The different topics expressed in the diary entries especially help to follow micro-psychological processes, which are far from being a simple reaction to interventions. The way patients experience themselves being in stability or instability and stagnation or transformation is surprisingly close to the general features of self-organizing processes in complex systems."

Among the latter, executive skills in everyday life play a significant role in dealing with the academic demands of adolescents. Therefore, the aim of this study is to ascertain the effects of executive symptomatology in everyday functioning on academic achievement in adolescents.MethodThe study involved students aged between and years from both public and private schools in the Community of Madrid. The DEX, BDEFS-CA, and BRIEF-SR questionnaires were utilised to assess executive difficulties, while grades in language, mathematics, and natural sciences were used as a measure of academic achievement.ResultsThe data revealed statistically significant differences in working memory, emotional control, materials organisation, and task completion. In relation to language and natural sciences subjects. In the case of mathematics, emotional control and task completion were significant variables.ConclusionOur results indicate that certain executive skills that are manifested in everyday life activities can contribute, albeit in a variable way, to academic achievement in the subjects studied. This aspect is relevant insofar as it allows us to develop preventive interventions based on the executive training of these everyday skills."

The neuroplasticity theory of depression postulates that a malfunction in neural plasticity, which is responsible for learning, memory, and adaptive behavior, is the primary source of the disorder's clinical manifestations. Nevertheless, the impact of depression symptoms on associative learning remains underexplored.MethodsWe used the differential fear conditioning paradigm to investigate the effects of depressive symptoms on fear acquisition and extinction learning. Skin conductance response is an objective evaluation indicator, and ratings of nervousness, likeability, and unconditioned stimuli expectancy are subjective evaluation indicators. In addition, we used associability generated by a computational reinforcement learning model to characterize the skin conductance response.ResultsThe findings indicate that individuals with depressive symptoms exhibited significant impairment in fear acquisition learning compared to those without depressive symptoms based on the results of the skin conductance response. Moreover, in the discrimination fear learning task, the skin conductance response was positively correlated with associability, as estimated by the hybrid model in the group without depressive symptoms. Additionally, the likeability rating scores improved post-extinction learning in the group without depressive symptoms, and no such increase was observed in the group with depressive symptoms.ConclusionThe study highlights that individuals with pronounced depressive symptoms exhibit impaired fear acquisition and extinction learning, suggesting a possible deficit in associative learning. Employing the hybrid model to analyze the learning process offers a deeper insight into the associative learning processes of humans, thus allowing for improved comprehension and treatment of these mental health problems."

Utilizing a natural conversation corpus, this paper thoroughly examines the intentional communication scenes of five Mandarin-speaking children before the age of ; . We found that children produced a limited yet high-frequency set of intonation words such as “啊 [a], 哎 [æ], 欸 [ε], 嗯 [ən], 呃 [ə], eng [əŋ], 哦 [o], and 咦 [i].” These intonation words do not express the children’s emotional attitudes toward propositions or events; rather, they are utilized within the frameworks of imperative, declarative, and interrogative intents. The children employ non-verbal, multimodal means such as pointing, gesturing, and facial expressions to actively convey or receive commands, provide or receive information, and inquire or respond. The data suggests that the function of intonation words is essentially equivalent to holophrases, indicating the initial stage of syntactic acquisition, which is a milestone in early syntactic development. Based on the cross-linguistic universality of intonation word acquisition and its inherited relationship with pre-linguistic intentional vocalizations, this paper proposes that children’s syntax is initiated by the prosodic features of intonation. The paper also contends that intonation words, as the initial form of human vocal language in individual development, naturally extend from early babbling, emotional vocalizations, or sound expressions for changing intentions. They do not originate from spontaneous gesturing, which seems to have no necessary evolutionary relationship with the body postures that chimpanzees use to change intentions, as suggested by existing research. Human vocal language and non-verbal multimodal means are two parallel and non-contradictory forms of communication, with no apparent evidence of the former inheriting from the latter."

Previous empirical works comparing these two modes of actions, however, have largely relied on subjective judgments on the imagery process, which may be exposed to various biases. The current study aims to re-examine the commonality and distinguishable aspects of motor imagery and execution via a response repetition paradigm. This framework aims to offer an alternative approach devoid of self-reporting, opening the opportunity for less subjective evaluation of the disparities and correlations between motor imagery and motor execution.MethodsParticipants performed manual speeded-choice on prime-probe pairs in each trial under three conditions distinguished by the modes of response on the prime: mere observation , imagining response , and actual responses . Responses to the following probe were all actual execution of button press. While Experiment compared the basic repetition effects in the three prime conditions, Experiment extended the prime duration to enhance the quality of MI and monitored electromyography for excluding prime imagery with muscle activities to enhance specificity of the underlying mechanism.ResultsIn Experiment , there was no significant repetition effect after mere observation. However, significant repetition effects were observed in both imagery and execution conditions, respectively, which were also significantly correlated. In Experiment , trials with excessive EMG activities were excluded before further statistical analysis. A consistent repetition effect pattern in both Imagery and Execution but not the Perception condition. Now the correlation between Imagery and Execution conditions were not significant.ConclusionFindings from the current study provide a novel application of a classical paradigm, aiming to minimize the subjectivity inherent in imagery assessments while examining the relationship between motor imagery and motor execution. By highlighting differences and the absence of correlation in repetition effects, the study challenges the functional equivalence hypothesis of imagery and execution. Motor representations of imagery and execution, when measured without subjective judgments, appear to be more distinguishable than traditionally thought. Future studies may examine the neural underpinnings of the response repetition paradigm to further elucidating the common and separable aspects of these two modes of action."

The healthcare workforce is exposed to challenging tasks and a high work pace, a situation that worsened during and after the COVID- pandemic. In turn, exposure to these high demands contributes to poor health, increased turnover, reduced job satisfaction, reduced efficacy, and reduced patient satisfaction and safety. Therefore, it is imperative that we identify measures to mitigate this crisis. One piece of this puzzle is how to implement sustainable tools and processes to improve the work environment of healthcare organizations. In this paper, we present the study protocol for the outlining and piloting of a joint training for pairs of healthcare line managers and their associated health and safety representatives in a Swedish healthcare organization. The objective of the training is to aid and advance the implementation of interventions to improve the work environment at the unit level. Following recommendations in the literature, the training is based on a stepwise approach that considers the specific context and focuses on the involvement of employees in creating interventions based on their needs. A central component of the training is the development of the pairs’ collaboration in prioritizing, developing, implementing, and evaluating the interventions. The training is based on an on-the-job train-the-trainer approach in which participants are progressively trained during four workshops in the steps of a participatory intervention process. Between these workshops, the pairs follow the same progressive steps together with their employees to develop and implement interventions at their unit. The pilot will involve four pairs representing different parts and functions of the organization and will be conducted over a period of three months. We will use a mixed method design to evaluate preconditions, the process, and proximal transfer and implementation outcome factors of the training. The overall aim of the pilot is to appraise its feasibility and be able to adjust the training before a potential scale-up."

It contributes insights into how a decolonizing coaching space enables and guides a coachee to reflect and rethink the navigation of the realities of her decolonial identity. The decolonial identity encapsulates the authentic self and the neoliberal identity is the plastic self in a neoliberal university context. Universities' pervasive and normalized neoliberal discourse has become a “paradigm”—the overarching worldview through which universities' visions, missions, strategic objectives, and values are constructed. For academics to thrive in their performance and “walk on water” in achieving performance targets, they ought to embrace being academic capitalists, which shapes idealized neoliberal identities—conforming identities, complicit in undermining social, economic, and epistemic justice. Qualitative research methods were utilized to conduct a reflexive study, and data collected from the reflections and reflexive dialogues in leadership development coaching sessions and journals were thematically analyzed. The study reveals that the coach and coachee's shared decolonial identity offered counter-narratives that unmask the dominant great “white” man leadership in organizations. It also illuminates insights into the significance of black feminist pedagogy in the coaching process to honor the coachee's decolonial identity and rich cultural experiences. It enabled her to explore them critically and derive meanings from developing decolonizing, critically conscious leadership strategies for emerging transformation challenges.

One of the least researched teaching techniques in writing motivation studies is genre-based instruction. In this study, we examined the impact of genre-based instruction on Saudi university students’ English argumentative and classification essay writing performance and their writing motivation dimensions . Drawing upon the quasi-experimental research design and non-random sampling technique, we used genre-based instruction with a representative intact class of English-as-a-foreign-language writing students at a Saudi university. To examine the potential impact of the treatment, we collected pre- and post-instruction data, along with data gathered through an open-ended questionnaire. The results showed that genre-based instruction has contributed significantly to improving the students’ writing performance and also their writing motivation dimensions. These positive gains varied from one writing quality aspect and motivational variable to another. The students’ answers to the open-ended questionnaire also showed the positive writing learning and motivation improvements they experienced. It is generally concluded that developing students’ language and rhetorical awareness and text composition performance seems to be a prerequisite for improving their writing motivation levels. The paper ends with discussing the implications of the results."

We conducted an analysis using inductive content analysis on open-ended survey data collected from formally trained professional dancers. Additionally, we analyzed interview data from seven professional dancers who demonstrated outstanding achievements in the field among the survey participants. The main themes that emerged were related to various temporal events of peak performance experience: pre-stage, on-stage, and post-stage. During the on-stage, peak performance was perceived by both internal and external factors. During the pre-stage, emphasis was placed on technical, cognitive, and artistic strategies during practice, whereas just before going on the stage, attention shifted to psychological and physical strategies. During the post-stage, dancers reported immediate changes in their psychological and physical states following the peak performance experience, and thereafter, the peak performance experience was noted to influence psychological, technical, and cognitive aspects. These findings provide valuable insights into the key characteristics that emerge throughout a series of peak performance experiences and are consistent with previous research."

The overarching goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the neurodynamic patterns associated with affective regulation, potentially informing the development of biomarkers for therapeutic interventions in mood and anxiety disorders.MethodsUtilizing EEG microstate analysis during self-generated affective states, we investigated the temporal dynamics of five distinct microstates across different conditions, including baseline resting state and self-generated states of positive valence and negative valence .ResultsThe study revealed noteworthy modulations in microstate dynamics during affective states. Additionally, valence-specific mechanisms of spontaneous affective regulation were identified. Negative valence affective states were characterized by the heightened presence of attention-associated microstates and reduced occurrence of salience-related microstates during negative valence states. In contrast, positive valence affective states manifested a prevalence of microstates related to visual/autobiographical memory and a reduced presence of auditory/language-associated microstates compared to both baseline and negative valence states.DiscussionThis study contributes to the field by employing EEG microstate analysis to discern the temporal dynamics of brain networks involved in self-generated affective states.

Four experiments examined this, also exploring the downstream impacts of moral character judgments. Adults who seemed disgusting were regarded as more immoral for purity and non-purity violations and less praiseworthy for prosocial acts . In Experiment , an -year-old with typical habits was rated as “naughtier” and likelier to misbehave than an atypical child who loved vegetables and disliked sweets.

This influx significantly diversified the then predominantly monolingual landscape of Polish schools. Given the uniqueness of this situation and the fact that Poland has historically remained mono-national and monolingual for decades, Polish teachers suffered from a lack of preparedness, resources and expertise to effectively navigate their teaching practices in multilingual classes. To understand the specificity of this situation, taking especially into account the perspective of educators, we have designed a qualitative study drawing on focus group and individual interview reports. We were particularly interested in determining how teachers' agency was activated in times of crisis. The findings reveal how the newly-emerging linguistic and cultural heterogeneity is perceived by teachers, how it is manifested in school and home environments, and the extent to which possibilities for synergies exist between the two. The findings also highlight the fact that, despite teachers' inexperience and unpreparedness for the new educational context, they instantly responded to the challenges that emerged.

Emotions such as restlessness, anxiety, anger, and nervousness are commonly found among dental healthcare workers. Pediatric dental clinics are an important part of dental clinics, but there is a lack of research on the soundscape within pediatric dental clinics.MethodsThis study focuses on a typical pediatric dental clinic, using a combination of field questionnaires and objective measurements. It aims to determine the impact of dominant sound sources on the emotional perception and hostile emotional responses of users in the pediatric dental clinic.ResultsIn the soundscape of pediatric dental clinics for young pediatric patients, users experience negative emotional perceptions and emotional responses of hostility. The dominant sound sources can be divided into two categories: dental and nondental . Under the influence of dental dominant sound sources, there was a significant negative correlation between the emotional perceptions of healthcare workers and their negative emotional perceptions . Conversely, for young pediatric patients aged – years, a significant positive correlation was observed between their emotional perceptions and negative emotional perceptions. The mean perceived degrees of nervousness and fear in young pediatric patients were . and . times stronger, respectively, than those observed in healthcare workers.

To address the second inquiry, combining articulatory suppression paradigm, normal sighted participants and blind participants discriminated voice identity, when listening forward speech from their own native language and another unfamiliar language.ResultsIn Experiment , not only in the voice identity discrimination task with forward speech, but also in the discrimination task with backward speech, both the sighted and blind groups showed the superiority of the native language. This finding supports the view that backward speech still retains some phonetic information, and indicates that phonetic information can affect voice identity processing in sighted and blind people. In addition, only the superiority of the native language of sighted people was regulated by the speech manner, which is related to articulatory rehearsal. In Experiment , only the superiority of the native language of sighted people was regulated by articulatory suppression. This indicates that phonetic information may act in different ways on voice identity processing in sighted and blind people.ConclusionThe heightened dependence on voice source information in blind people appears not to undermine the function of phonetic information, but it appears to change the functional mechanism of phonetic information. These findings suggest that the present phonetic familiarity model needs to be improved with respect to the mechanism of phonetic information."

While extensive research exists on various aspects of Ukrainian– Russian bilingualism in relation to Ukraine itself, thus far no studies have been conducted on this bilingualism in the diasporic context, i.e., as a language of the first and subsequential generations with a migrant background in Austria and Germany.MethodsTo address this research gap, our paper examines the language attitudes of two respondent groups with a Ukrainian background in the two countries: migrants and refugees who left Ukraine after and those who left after Russia’s invasion in February . In the framework of a sociolinguistic survey, we describe their current attitudes regarding the use of Ukrainian and Russian, among others, in relation to the actual and intended use of the language in the multilingual context of migration. The survey eliciting information on demographic information, language proficiency, language attitudes and language use was conducted on Ukrainians in two host countries . First, we compared self-rated proficiency in Ukrainian and Russian as well as attitudes and use of these languages. Second, we applied a network modelling analysis to determine the nature of relationships between these variables.Results and discussionThe results indicated that proficiency in Ukrainian and in Russian were the strongest nodes in the model affecting language use and language attitudes toward the respective languages. Our data analysis focused on the pragmatic and symbolic value of Russian and Ukrainian playing a crucial role in the language vitality in multilingual settings. The paper discusses the imbalanced correlation of the symbolic and pragmatic value of Ukrainian and Russian in the diasporic Ukrainian communities. While Ukrainian has gained a higher symbolic status, Russian maintains a better pragmatic one, despite its negative symbolic status. However, we anticipate that the increasing symbolic value of Ukrainian and the diminishing value of Russian will lead to an increase in the use of Ukrainian also in Russian-dominant bilingual groups of Ukrainian migrants and refugees, even as an insider-code in hermetic minority groups."

Recent psychological studies have indicated that young adults show efficient value learning for neutral faces and the detection of “value-associated faces,” while older adults show slightly different patterns of value learning and value-based detection of neutral faces. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unknown. To investigate this, we applied hierarchical reinforcement learning and diffusion models to a value learning task and value-driven detection task that involved neutral faces; the tasks were completed by young and older adults. The results for the learning task suggested that the sensitivity of learning feedback might decrease with age. In the detection task, the younger adults accumulated information more efficiently than the older adults, and the perceptual time leading to motion onset was shorter in the younger adults. In younger adults only, the reward sensitivity during associative learning might enhance the accumulation of information during a visual search for neutral faces in a rewarded task. These results provide insight into the processing linked to efficient detection of faces associated with emotional values, and the age-related changes therein."

Here, we explored if this learning benefit can be observed from the very initial stages of second language acquisition and whether the effect of redundancy is modulated by the perceptual salience of the redundant linguistic cues. Across two experiments, three groups of adult native speakers of English were incidentally exposed to three different artificial languages; one that had a fixed word order, Verb-Object-Subject, and two in which thematic role assignment was additionally determined by a low-salient or a high-salient redundant case marker. While all groups managed to learn the novel language, our results pointed towards a hindering role of redundancy, with participants in the non-redundant condition achieving greater learning outcomes compared to those in both redundant conditions. Results also revealed that this impeding effect of redundancy on L learners can be attenuated by the salience of the redundant cue .

In the same time, ASQ- communication and personal-social scores were negatively correlated with cortisol level . The ROC-curve analysis revealed that a decrease of melatonin below . ng/mL and . ng/mL during the neonatal period could predict communication and problem-solving delay, respectively. An increase in cortisol above . mcg/dl is predictive in personal-social delay. Negative correlation was identified between the NICU and total hospital stay duration and ASQ- communication scores in the follow-up . The duration of mechanical ventilation was negatively correlated with gross motor scores . Apgar score was positively correlated with ASQ- communication and personal-social scores ; maternal age—with ASQ- total , communication , and personal-social scores . Positive correlations were observed between gestational age and communication scores . Infants who suffered neonatal sepsis had significantly often delay of communication and gross motor skills .

Both movements co-occur during a performance; however, the interaction between the movements is still unclear.MethodsUsing motion capture technology, the movement patterns of clarinetists were analyzed at certain points in a performance to investigate how instrumental and ancillary movements interplay. Movements in the arms and knees of clarinetists during a performance were recorded using this technology. The mean angular movements at specific points in the piece, where some players inhaled and others did not, were compared.ResultsWhile the players who inhaled adopted significantly more upright body and neutral arm positions, the players who did not inhale seemed less interrupted in their performance. The results showed that the players performed rather individual ancillary movements, but at specific points, such as during melodic transitions, they performed similarly. At certain points in the melody, while some players needed to inhale, others adjusted their playing according to the inhalation moment to adopt a suitable body position.DiscussionThe ancillary movement was consequently interrupted by the physiological necessity to inhale.

The substantial challenge here is to control automatic processes like competitive anxiety and stress. Hypnosis can address these automatic processes. We developed and evaluated a hypnosis audio-intervention to activate the optimal racing mindset.MethodsIn our study, elite Downhill Mountainbike athletes registered at two consecutive races of the IXS Downhill Cup. After the first race, athletes listened to the hypnosis audio-intervention. In this intervention, we instructed the athletes how to activate their optimal mental state before the second race. At both races, we measured competitive anxiety, stress, self-confidence, state resilience, and flow with validated questionnaires and assessed resting heart rate variability as physiological measure of resilience.ResultsRace-related somatic anxiety and subjective stress decreased significantly while self-confidence increased significantly from first to second race after athletes listened to the hypnosis. Heart rate variability was significantly increased at the second race indicating elevated vagal activity. When comparing race results of our participants to a control group of other elite athletes competing in the races but not listening to the hypnosis, we found that our study participants generally performed better in both races.ConclusionThe study shows that our hypnosis intervention was effective in reducing competitive anxiety and stress while increasing perceived resilience and self-confidence: After a self-administered hypnosis session, athletes were able to improve automatic processes responsible for putting them in their mental pole position."

We did so by presenting a rhythmically flickering visual bar of Hz before the cue - either on the cue’s side or opposite the cue -while an arrhythmically flickering visual bar was presented on the respective other side. We hypothesized that rhythmic entrainment at cue location could enhance the suppression of the cue. Testing participants ranging from to years of age, we found both behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of suppression: Search times for a target at a negatively cued location were delayed relative to a target away from the cued location . In addition, an event-related potential indicative for suppression was observed following rhythmic but not arrhythmic stimulation, indicating that suppression was boosted by the stimulation. This was also echoed in higher spectral power and intertrial phase coherence of EEG at rhythmically versus arrhythmically stimulated electrode sites, albeit only at the second harmonic , but not at the stimulation frequency. In addition, inverse validity effects were not modulated by rhythmic entrainment congruent with the cue side. Hence, we propose that rhythmic visual stimulation in the alpha range could support suppression, though behavioral evidence remains elusive, in contrast to electrophysiological findings."

In particular, the procedure requires family members to play according to different interactive configurations and therefore different microtransitions from one configuration to another. As such, the procedure allows to study how family members coordinate to maintain stability, promote change, and encourage members to explore different interactive configurations within the family system. TIAP has been validated through several studies conducted with different non-clinical groups of families that have highlighted the salient aspects of family functioning, and significant correlations with variables external to the family system, such as children’s social–emotional competence in the educational context. This paper focuses on the use of TIAP in the contexts of assessing parental competence. Specifically, the article aims to describe, through the reference to a clinical case, the results emerged from a study conducted with families involved in a parenting assessment process. The study is part of a broader collaborative project between the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Clinic of the Italian National Health Service in Parma, the University of Parma, and the Bologna Family Therapy Center. TIAP was administered to all the families involved as a complement to other tools routinely used for all cases handled by the professionals of the clinic. The coding system includes different indices. Some analyze the interactive family modes: family coordination , the responses to potentials for change , and intra-familiar exploration. Other indices concern the quality of the interactions: the relational triadic dynamic of microtransition and the consistency/inconsistency of the communication channels. The results highlighted how TIAP makes it possible to identify the specific interactive modalities of the different members and their interdependence and reciprocity, favoring the identification of both family weaknesses and family resources, including the children’s contribution. Furthermore, the general data trend showed that TIAP indices detect some important prognostic elements capable of guiding the court’s decisions."

In addition, we used a bias-corrected Bootstrap approach to test the significance of the mediating effect, the mediation effect of cues to action between undergraduates' perceived susceptibility and mental health help-seeking behavior was utterly significant [mediation effect value of ., with an SE value of . and a % CI ]. It demonstrated that those who perceived themselves to be at high risk of developing a mental illness and who had received encouragement or counseling to seek mental health help were more likely to be motivated to seek mental health help. Multiple regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy and cues to action independently influenced behavioral intentions. Encouragement or counseling from others would be more likely to motivate undergraduates to seek mental health help."

Based on Self-Determination Theory, this study examines the mediating effect of basic psychological needs and the moderating effect of power distance on the relationship between servant leadership and followers' thriving at work. The results from the between-subject experimental design indicate that servant leadership can satisfy followers' three basic psychological needs. And the results from a questionnaire survey of civil servants at two-time points indicate: Servant leadership has a significantly positive impact on followers' thriving at work; All three basic psychological needs satisfaction serve as a mediator in the relationship between servant leadership and followers' thriving at work; Power distance negatively moderates the relationship between servant leadership and the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs, meaning that the lower on the power distance, the stronger the positive relationship between servant leadership and the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs; Power distance negatively moderates the mediating effects of competence needs satisfaction and relatedness needs satisfaction in the relationship between servant leadership and followers' thriving at work, indicating that the lower on the power distance, the stronger the mediating effects. Our findings highlight the important role of servant leadership in fostering followers' thriving at work and explore the critical role of basic psychological needs satisfaction. This provides empirical evidence to further refine theories regarding thriving at work, and suggests that in order to promote employee thriving, it is important to guide leaders to reevaluating and repositioning their roles."

Relevant information of the study participants was obtained using online questionnaires, covering five aspects—general information, physical state, emotional state, PTSD, and PTG.ResultsIn Wuhan, .% of COVID--diagnosed hospitalized patients exhibited hyper-arousal symptoms of PTSD. This percentage is significantly higher than the .% observed in the healthy population. Furthermore, the prevalence of PTG among the same group of hospitalized patients stood at .%, surpassing the .% rate found within the healthy population. It was determined that inconsistent sleep patterns during the hospitalization phase could be indicative of heightened vulnerability to hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD in COVID--diagnosed hospitalized patients. The study determined that inconsistent sleep patterns during hospitalization may be a predisposition factor that makes hospitalized patients diagnosed with covid- more susceptible to high arousal symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conversely, COVID--diagnosed hospitalized patients who maintained a tranquil demeanor and exhibited positive emotional perceptions during their hospitalization displayed reduced susceptibility to these PTSD symptoms. Factors such as possession of a bachelor’s degree, history of severe acute respiratory syndrome infection, and poor sleep patterns were identified as predictors elevating the risk of PTG. Whereas, a sentiment of happiness and consistent positive emotional perception during hospitalization were predictors of PTG.

To answer these questions, this study explores monolingual and bilingual infants’ ability to form face-language associations throughout the first year of life.MethodsA group of -, -, and -month-old Spanish and/or Catalan monolingual and bilingual infants were tested in an eye-tracking preferential-looking paradigm . After the infants were familiarized with videos of a Catalan and a Spanish speaker, they were tested in two types of test trials with different task demands. First, a Silent test trial assessed primary face-language associations by measuring infants’ visual preference for the speakers based on the language they had previously used. Then, two Language test trials assessed more robust face-language associations by measuring infants’ ability to match the face of each speaker with their corresponding language.ResultsWhen measuring primary face-language associations, both monolingual and bilingual infants exhibited language-based preferences according to their specific exposure to the languages. Interestingly, this preference varied with age, with a transition from an initial familiarity preference to a novelty preference in older infants. Four-month-old infants showed a preference for the speaker who used their native/dominant language, while -month-old infants preferred the speaker who used their non-native/non-dominant language.

Using this framework, we empirically examine the structure of schemas and their relationships to facial emotion recognition, a crucial ability that can widely affect our social interactions.MethodsA sample of adults completed an emotion recognition task and the Young Schema Questionnaire.

Children who exhibit reading difficulties are more likely to experience various negative professional and personal consequences. To successfully identify children with reading problems as early as possible, one must first understand how reading skills can be mastered, as well as the course of reading development in children with typical reading skills from the beginning of their formal reading instruction. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of decoding and language comprehension on reading comprehension ability. In addition, this study aimed to determine types of profiles among poor readers and estimate their frequency in the study sample.MethodsBased on the Simple View of Reading model, we developed decoding, language comprehension, and reading comprehension tasks. Participants included typical readers and poor readers in the second grade in Croatian schools. Phonemic awareness, phonological working memory, and rapid automatized naming tasks were used to test underlying abilities of decoding skills in both groups of participants.ResultsAs expected, PRs showed significantly lower performance on all variables than TRs. The correlations between decoding, language comprehension and reading comprehension are significant in the PR group. The linear regression analysis showed that language comprehension was a significant predictor of reading comprehension for TRs, while decoding and language comprehension were significant predictors of reading comprehension for PRs. The profiling of reading difficulties revealed five different profiles, the most common of which was a mixed reading difficulty, i.e., difficulties in both decoding and language comprehension.DiscussionIn line with theoretical expectations, success in reading comprehension in TRs at the end of the second grade depends mainly on language comprehension. To achieve this complex cognitive skill, PRs‘ language comprehension alone is not sufficient, so they still rely on their decoding skills.

The price range of cosmetic products was also considered. Subjective evaluations of the skin surface, emotions, and self-confidence were equally measured after looking in the mirror at each step of the cosmetic behavior. Linear mixed models were fitted to examine whether the subjective experience could be explained by the variety of cosmetic products and/or physiological responses.ResultsThe subjective evaluation was summarized into the following three factors using a factor analysis: self-confidence, hedonic perception, and negative emotion. Each theta-band power, alpha-band power of the EEG, and heart rate variability measures were subjected to a principal component analysis separately. The linear mixed models indicated that the variation in the self-confidence score and the negative emotion score was explained only by the steps of cosmetic behaviors, that is, self-confidence increased while negative emotions decreased as the steps of cosmetic behaviors proceeded. On the other hand, the hedonic perception score was explained by the interaction of the steps of cosmetic behaviors and price, indicating that positive tactile perception and positive emotion were higher when luxury cosmetic products were applied than when affordable products were applied. Furthermore, the model indicated that the hedonic perception score was positively associated with the alpha-band power over occipital sites whereas sympathetic nervous system activity was negatively associated with the alpha-band power over lateral central sites.DiscussionThese results suggest that positive perceptual and emotional experiences are associated with greater attention to somatosensory information than to visual information and sympathetic autonomic nervous system activities.

Existing evidence suggests that children with DLD may experience challenges in lexical access and retrieval, as well as greater lexical competition compared to their peers with Typical Development . However, the specific nature of these difficulties remains unclear. Using eye-tracking methodology, the study investigated the real-time comprehension of semantic relationships in children with DLD and their age-matched peers. The results revealed that, for relatively frequent nouns, both groups demonstrated similar comprehension of semantic relationships. Both groups favored the semantic competitor when it appeared with an unrelated visual referent. In turn, when the semantic competitor appeared with the visual referent of the spoken word, both groups disregarded the competitor. This finding shows that, although children with DLD usually present a relatively impoverished vocabulary, frequent nouns may not pose greater difficulties for them. While the temporal course of preference for the competitor or the referent was similar between the two groups, numerical, though non-significant, differences in the extension of the clusters were observed. In summary, this research demonstrates that monolingual preschoolers with DLD exhibit similar lexical access to frequent words compared to their peers with TD.

While existing knowledge tracing models often incorporate information such as students' exercise answering history and skill mastery level, they frequently overlook the students' mental states during the learning process.MethodsThis paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel psychological factors-enhanced heterogeneous learning interactive graph knowledge tracing model . This model delineates the interactions among students, exercises, and skills through a heterogeneous graph, supplementing it with four psychological factors that capture students' mental states during the learning process: frustration level, confusion level, concentration level, and boredom level. In the modeling of students' learning processes, we incorporate the forgetting curve and construct relevant cognitive parameters from the features. Additionally, we employ the Item Response Theory model to predict students' performance in answering exercises at the subsequent time step. This model not only delves into the psychological aspects of students during the learning process but also integrates the simulation of forgetting, a natural phenomenon in the learning journey. The inclusion of cognitive parameters enhances the description of changes in students' abilities throughout the learning process. This dual focus allows for a more comprehensive understanding of students' learning behaviors while providing a high level of interpretability for the model.Results and discussionEmpirical validation of the Psy-KT model is conducted using four publicly available datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in predicting students' future performance. Through rigorous experimentation, the integration of psychological and forgetting factors in the Psy-KT model not only improves predictive accuracy but also enables educators to offer more targeted tutoring and advice, enhancing the overall efficacy of the learning experience."

The rising incidence of cataract cases has led to a significant number of patients experiencing negative emotions associated with vision loss, thereby diminishing their quality of life. In clinical practice, it is imperative for healthcare professionals to consider the psychological well-being of cataract patients. Currently, there is a scarcity of research focusing on psychological evaluations, such as assessing feelings of meaninglessness among individuals with cataracts.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the factors influencing the anxiety of existential meaninglessness and to explore the relationships among existential anxiety, Herth hope index levels and fear of progression in the elderly cataract-affected population. Additionally, it evaluates the effectiveness of Orem’s nursing care strategies.MethodsUtilizing a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Existential Meaninglessness Anxiety Scale , Herth Hope Index Level Scale, and the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form , this research employed convenience sampling for a cross-sectional and intervention study. The retrospective study sample comprised , individuals, while the intervention study included . The intervention design assessed psychological changes in existential meaninglessness following Orem’s preoperative nursing interventions. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to ascertain the determinants of EM-A within the population of elderly patients with senile cataracts. Pearson correlation analysis elucidated the relationship between EM-A, levels of hope, and the FoP-Q-SF among this demographic. Subsequent investigations, utilizing a t-test, evaluated the effects by comparing the data before and after the implementation of the interventions.ResultsThe correlation between EM-A, hope levels, and FoP-Q-SF was statistically significant . Factors such as age, education level, alcohol consumption habits, hope levels, and FoP-Q-SF scores significantly affected EM-A scores . Orem’s nursing framework significantly reduced existential anxiety .ConclusionAmong elderly patients with cataracts, existential anxiety was generally moderate. Hope levels and fear of progression were closely associated with the EM-A. The novel Orem preoperative care model effectively addresses clinical issues. In clinical practice, it is crucial to address psychological problems and enhance patients’ quality of life."

The study aims to identify and analyze the demographic factors that influence the learning approaches of these learners, providing insights for more effective teaching and learning of Chinese as a foreign language. Data are collected through questionnaires and interviews, and statistical analysis is conducted to explore the correlations between gender, age, learning duration, and learning strategies. The learning strategy model adopted in this study provides a comprehensive classification of language learning strategies. The results underscore the significance of incorporating these factors into language education programs, providing valuable insights into the unique needs and challenges encountered by learners from Central Asian countries. The findings indicate that students from Central Asian countries predominantly utilize social strategies, metacognitive strategies, and affective strategies in their Chinese language learning. These are followed by compensatory strategies, cognitive strategies, and memory strategies. While gender does not exert a significant impact on the utilization of Chinese learning strategies, there are discernible variations in memory and affective strategies between males and females. Age does not significantly affect overall learning strategies, but there are notable disparities in compensatory strategies among different age groups. Learning duration has a significant effect on compensation and metacognitive strategies.

Subjective well-being is an overall evaluation of the quality of life according to the standards set by individuals, which is of great significance to the development of college students. Based on the data published in the past years of China’s comprehensive social survey, this study uses panel model and adversarial explanatory structure model to analyze the influencing factors of subjective well-being of Chinese college students from five dimensions: social equity attitude, parental education, use of network, social interaction and physical health. The results show that social justice attitude, parents’ education, network use, social interaction and physical health have a positive impact on the subjective well-being of Chinese college students. Among them, the use of the network and the education of parents mainly affect the social justice attitude, social interaction attitude, physical health status, and ultimately affect the subjective well-being of college students. Based on the above conclusions, this study proposes strategies to improve the subjective well-being of college students, which has certain reference and guiding significance for educators and decision makers, and has reference significance for developing countries."

In a person-oriented approach, the present study identified varying profiles of performance for three cool EF facets: inhibition, working-memory updating, and cognitive flexibility, as well as two hot EF facets: affective decision-making and delay of gratification, in a community sample of , children via latent profile analysis. The best-fitting model allowed for partial dependence across the three cool EF and included four profiles: all-average , low-delay , regulated-decision-making , and low-inhibition . Age, binary sex, socio-economic status, multilingualism, and processing speed were identified as significant characteristics of EF profile membership. Longitudinally, a higher probability of belonging to the low-inhibition profile predicted lower rates of the self-regulatory outcome of inhibitory control year later, while belonging to the regulated-decision-making profile predicted lower rates of the ability to plan and organize years later. These results not only demonstrate the existence of subgroups with different concurrent within-person expressions of EF performance, but also identify related characteristics and longitudinal outcomes of subgroup membership. In turn, these conclusions stress the importance of person-oriented research to inform on differing weaknesses or strengths in EF performance for varying individuals, thereby providing valuable insight for educational and clinical research into the design of effective personalized support or interventions during middle childhood."

The launch of League of Legends , a prominent MOBA game, has captivated the enthusiastic pursuit of gamers in the MOBA community. The surge in MOBA game fervor, coupled with the influence of personal emotions, can result in excessive engagement, ultimately leading to addiction.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the moderating effects of visceral perception, behavior, and reflection on game players’ addiction within the framework of Leisure Theory , Uses and Gratification Theory , and Emotional Design Theory .MethodsA hypothesized theoretical model was developed and empirically evaluated based on self-reported validated responses from MOBA gamers. SPSS was employed for demographic analysis and game duration analysis. The measurement model and structural model analyses were conducted in two stages using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling with SmartPLS .. to validate the nine theoretical hypotheses.ResultsIt has been observed that personal emotions significantly contributes to MOBA game addiction during gamers’ leisure time or moments of gratification. Specifically, a noteworthy connection exists between two dimensions, namely gamers’ behavior and reflection, demonstrating a positive correlation with gaming addiction. Without taking entertainment as a motivating factor, there is no significant relationship between gamers’ leisure-time and visceral perception.ConclusionThis study enhances the theoretical model of gamers’ behavioral motives in engaging with MOBA gaming and contributes to the expansion of research on game addiction theory. These findings offer valuable theoretical insights for emotional design in games and the design of mechanisms for preventing game addiction."

Music-based therapies have been used extensively to address motor skills in non-autistic populations. Though a handful of studies exist on the effects of music-based therapies for movement in autistic children, none have investigated the possibility of administering sessions via telehealth. This mixed-methods pilot study investigated whether nine Neurologic Music Therapy ® sessions via telehealth would improve motor and attention skills in autistic children.MethodsFive autistic children between five and years of age participated in the study, with support from their caregivers. Motor skills were assessed using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency second edition, short form , and a selective attention and sustained attention task were taken from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children, Second Edition . Caregivers and the two neurologic music therapists involved in the study provided qualitative input about the perceived effectiveness of telehealth NMT for the children involved. Their responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Caregivers also filled out a Sensory Profile assessment prior to the onset of sessions so that each child’s sensory profile could be compared to their motor and attention results.ResultsStatistically significant improvements in motor skills were observed between pre-test assessment and a two-week follow-up assessment. Results from attention test scores were not significant. Caregivers and neurologic music therapists generally perceived sessions positively and noted the importance of having caregivers actively involved. When compared with individual progress on the BOT- SF assessment, sensory profile results revealed that children with fewer sensory sensitivities tended to improve the most on motor skills. The improvements in motor skills and positive caregiver and therapist views of telehealth indicate that NMT motor interventions administered via telehealth are a promising avenue of therapeutic support for movement skill development in autistic children."

Data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis using MAXQDA- software.FindingsStudy participants showed bicultural identities, which caused value conflicts and a feeling of being “caught” between Swiss and Albanian culture. Some participants experienced the fear of disappointing their parents. Others find it difficult to deal with conflicting norms and values. Parentification was another important cause within their cultural concept of distress. At the same time, social support, i.e., spending time with the family and the community, was an important coping mechanism.ConclusionSecond-generation immigrants are exposed to specific risk factors for psychological distress. A better understanding of these risk factors and their coping mechanisms is essential for providing them with meaningful support services, both in prevention and psychotherapy."

The sentences were sequentially displayed, and at ms post-sentence, a verb was shown – either the one previously mentioned or its semantic alternative counterpart .ResultsFindings revealed that anodal stimulation intensifies the inhibitory impact of negation during sentence comprehension. Under anodal conditions, negative sentences led to extended reading times for the mentioned verbs compared to their affirmative counterparts, suggesting an increased inhibitory effect on the verb. Furthermore, in avoidance sentences, anodal stimulation resulted in reduced reading times for alternative verbs in negative sentences compared to alternative verbs in negated approach sentences.DiscussionAs “avoidance” is semantically equivalent to “non-approach”, the inhibitory effect of negation is primarily applied to the implicit negation: NOT EXCLUDED = NOT→NOT , which consequently activates the representation of the alternative verb making it more available. We further discuss these findings in light of the rIFG’s pivotal role in processing attitudinal verbs and linguistic negation. This discussion is framed within the overarching context of the two-step model of negation processing, highlighting its significance in the realm of social communication."

From both the individual and organizational perspectives, enhancing employee resilience emerges as a critical issue not only in the practical and academic fields. In the Chinese culture, this research aims to investigate how and why collectivism-oriented human resource management fosters employee resilience. Drawing on the group engagement model, we propose a serial mediating effect of perceived overall fairness and three dimensions of social identity between C-HRM and employee resilience.MethodsUsing a sample of frontline employees in the hospitality industry, we conducted a field survey among employees and a two-wave online survey among hospitality employees .ResultsFindings from empirical analysis indicated that C-HRM significantly increases overall fairness perception of hospitality frontline employees and in turn, their identification and respect, which further fertilize employee resilience. In addition, the indirect effect of C-HRM on employee resilience through perceived overall fairness and pride was not statistically significant.DiscussionThese important findings are expected to help employees cope with the workplace pressures caused by ongoing challenges and change, and contribute to sustainable career development."

These experiments used for model comparison involve modeling human learning and decision making based on both visual information and natural language, in tasks that vary in realism and complexity. This comparison of applications takes as its basis Instance-Based Learning Theory, a theory of experiential decision making from which many models have emerged and been applied to a variety of domains and applications.ResultsThe best performing model from the ablation we performed used a generative model to both create memory representations as well as predict participant actions. The results of this comparison demonstrates the importance of generative models in both forming memories and predicting actions in decision-modeling research.DiscussionIn this work, we present a model that integrates generative and cognitive models, using a variety of stimuli, applications, and training methods.

Differentiation of DCD and ADHD is crucial for a better understanding of the conditions and targeted support. Measuring electrical brain activity with EEG may help to discern and better understand the conditions given that it can objectively capture changes and potential differences in brain activity related to externally measurable symptoms beneficial for targeted interventions. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to exploratorily examine neurophysiological differences between adults with DCD and/or ADHD at rest. A total of N = adults with DCD , ADHD , both DCD + ADHD , or typical development completed min of rest with eyes-closed and eyes-open while their EEG was recorded. Spectral power was calculated for frequency bands: delta , theta , alpha , beta , mu , gamma . Within-participants, spectral power in a majority of waveforms significantly increased from eyes-open to eyes-closed conditions. Groups differed significantly in occipital beta power during the eyes-open condition, driven by the DCD versus typically developing group comparison. However, other group comparisons reached only marginal significance, including whole brain alpha and mu power with eyes-open, and frontal beta and occipital high gamma power during eyes-closed. While no strong markers could be determined to differentiate DCD versus ADHD, we theorize that several patterns in beta activity were indicative of potential motor maintenance differences in DCD at rest. Therefore, larger studies comparing EEG spectral power may be useful to identify neurological mechanisms of DCD and continued differentiation of DCD and ADHD."

Here, we investigated the effects of intermodal and intramodal task-irrelevant information on visual and auditory categorical decision-making. In both visual and auditory tasks, we manipulated the modality of irrelevant inputs and used linear discrimination analysis of EEG and hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling to identify when and how task-irrelevant information affected decision-relevant processing. The results revealed modality-specific impacts of irrelevant inputs on visual and auditory categorical decision-making. The distinct effects on the visual task were shown on the neural components, with auditory distractors amplifying the sensory processing whereas visual distractors amplifying the post-sensory process. Conversely, the distinct effects on the auditory task were shown in behavioral performance and underlying cognitive processes. Visual distractors facilitate behavioral performance and affect both stages, but auditory distractors interfere with behavioral performance and impact on the sensory processing rather than the post-sensory decision stage. Overall, these findings suggested that auditory distractors affect the sensory processing stage of both tasks while visual distractors affect the post-sensory decision stage of visual categorical decision-making and both stages of auditory categorical decision-making.

This cross-section study included teachers at all school levels in Türkiye. The research data was collected through a convenience sampling method using an online survey. Participants completed self-report measures of meaning in life, psychological flexibility, perceived occupational stress, job satisfaction, job performance, and psychological distress. Pearson product–moment correlation and parallel mediation model using PROCESS macro were utilized to analyze the data. The results showed that perceived occupational stress had a significant effect on meaning in life, psychological flexibility, job satisfaction, job performance, and psychological distress. Also, meaning in life and psychological flexibility had significant effects on job satisfaction, job performance, and psychological distress. Furthermore, meaning in life and psychological flexibility partially mediated the relationships between occupational stress and job satisfaction, job performance, and psychological distress. These findings highlight the significance of considering meaning in life and psychological flexibility as crucial factors in mitigating the impact of occupational stress on employee mental health and work productivity. By focusing on enhancing employees’ sense of meaning and their ability to adapt flexibly to workplace challenges, organizations can potentially create a better environment that fosters positive outcomes for both employees and the organization. However, the impact of occupational stress on job performance, job satisfaction and psychological distress may change over time.

This also includes some gender bias concerning a mother being the best person to primarily raise her children. Some psychology scholars have pointed out that this attitude causes much stress, anxiety, depression, and a sense of guilt among mothers. However, its effects on children have yet to be revealed using an extensive survey, and this indicates the need to investigate any possible impact of an intensive parenting attitude on children. The aim of this study was to elucidate a link between a maternal intensive parenting attitude and their children’s social competence through maternal parenting behavior. This was based on collecting data from Japanese women who were mothers of preschoolers using the Japanese version of the Intensive Parenting Attitude Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Parenting Scale, and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. The results showed that the “Essentialism,” “Fulfillment,” and “Child-centered” components of intensive parenting attitude influenced the “involvement and monitoring” and “positive responsivity” of parenting behavior. Furthermore, these two parenting behaviors affected children’s prosocial behavior and hyperactivity/inattention. These findings suggest that an intensive parenting attitude has some impact on children as well as mothers, both positively and negatively, pointing to a serious effect on society."

The results revealed that novel metaphors elicited larger N amplitudes compared to conventional metaphors, aligning with previous findings. In contrast, no significant N differences were observed between conventional and novel similes, suggesting that familiarity disparity is unlikely to account for N distinctions. Our findings imply that conventional and novel metaphors undergo distinct cognitive processing mechanisms , thereby providing further empirical validation for the Career of Metaphor Theory."

Changes in brain activity regulate and support these phenomena. However, the heterogeneity of meditation practices and their cultural background, as well as their poor categorization limit the generalization of results to all types of meditation. Here, we took advantage of a collaboration with the very singular and precious community of the Monks and Geshes of the Tibetan University of Sera-Jey in India to study the neural correlates of the two main types of meditation recognized in Tibetan Buddhism, namely concentrative and analytical meditation. Twenty-three meditators with different levels of expertise underwent to an ecological EEG acquisition consisting of an analytical and/or concentrative meditation session at “their best,” and with the only constraint of performing a -min-long baseline at the beginning of the session. Time-varying power-spectral-density estimates of each session were compared against the baseline and between conditions . Our results showed that concentrative meditation elicited more numerous and marked changes in the EEG power compared to analytical meditation, and mainly in the form of an increase in the theta, alpha and beta frequency ranges. Moreover, the full immersion in the Monastery life allowed to share the results and discuss their interpretation with the best scholars of the Monastic University, ensuring the identification of the most expert meditators, as well as to highlight better the differences between the different types of meditation practiced by each of them."

With greater accessibility to sports, recent trends have shown increased rates of sports specialization over the past decade in youth athletes. Athletic identity measures the strength an individual is tied to the athlete role and can be formed in conjunction to adolescent identity formation. More specialized youth athletes may have stronger ties to their athletic identity during their adolescent identity formation period.MethodsYouth basketball athletes were surveyed on specialization levels and athletic identity via the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale , including three submeasures: social identity, exclusivity, and negative affectivity.ResultsParticipants showed stronger identification to social identity items and the weakest identification with exclusivity items. Athletes reporting more time spent playing their primary sport presented higher scores across all measures of athletic identity, and total athletic identity was stronger in athletes reporting specialization at an earlier age. Exclusivity and negative affectivity tended to increase with specialization level which may primarily be driven by specialized athletes choosing to quit non-primary sports.DiscussionAthletic identity may be worth noting as a psychological indicator of potential risk of injury.

The study aims to contribute valuable information that guides the introduction of VR technology, ensuring its optimal use in the complex context of forensic mental healthcare.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare providers working at forensic outpatient clinics and forensic psychiatric patients . All participants experienced VR before the interview. Inductive thematic analysis was employed for analyzing the interview data.ResultsPatients valued the unique opportunity to simulate personal experiences in VR scenarios and reflect on them with healthcare providers. In addition to positive first impressions, areas for improvement were identified, including the wish for enhanced realism and reduced physical discomfort while immersed in VR. Finally, important factors contributing to the successful introduction of VR were identified. For example, taking into account psychological distress experienced by patients or supporting healthcare providers with implementation resources.ConclusionThe integration of VR into forensic mental healthcare holds great potential for behavior change.

Importantly, this relationship was moderated by social skills and impulsivity , such that increases in either were associated with decreased percent return and investments on future trials. Overall, we found that cooperation is an adaptive behavior which requires trust and reciprocity, and adolescents need to exhibit both of these behaviors to have fruitful interactions. These findings suggest that interventions to help students think about their partner’s perspective and stress the longer-term nature of interactions with peers would foster successful cooperation in social situations."

Our study aims to investigate the influence of Family Religiosity and climate on anger dysregulation and deviance propensity in a sample of justice-involved boys from Italian Youth Detention Centers . The sample was divided into religious and non-religious justice-involved juveniles. Participants filled in the following questionnaires: Deviant Behavior Questionnaire, Aggression Questionnaire, Family Communication Scale, Moral Disengagement Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. We used a partial least square structural equation modeling method to build our model and we found that Family Religiosity was positively associated with Family Climate which was negatively associated with Anger Dysregulation and Deviance Propensity, and Anger Dysregulation was positively related to Deviance Propensity. The multigroup analysis confirmed that for justice-involved juveniles who interiorized religious discipline and beliefs, Family Religiosity showed a positive association with Family Climate, which had a negative relationship with Anger Dysregulation, which strongly predicted Deviance Propensity. This result could be useful to promote new development goals and preventive activities and interventions based on positive religiosity values in juveniles’ behavior."

A growing body of evidence underscores the necessity of adhering to recommended levels of regular physical activity to thwart the onset of chronic diseases. One primary aim of school physical education initiatives is to elevate physical activity levels and bolster student motivation toward engaging in physical exercise. Engagement in sports activities has demonstrated efficacy in augmenting students’ motor skills, elevating their self-efficacy, and enhancing cognitive competencies related to physical prowess, while also promoting sustained participation in physical activities. The Exercise Empowerment Scale has been formulated to quantitatively assess the degree of exercise empowerment. To date, no validated Chinese version of the EES has been reported in the literature. To address this, this present study developed and validated a Chinese version of the EES in a large sample of Chinese college students.MethodsA sample of Chinese college students was analyzed using Rasch analysis to examine the validity of the Exercise Empowerment Scale. In addition, physical activity and psychological resilience were used to investigate the potential associations with exercise empowerment.ResultsThe EES-C was found to be a unidimensional scale, and the distribution of item difficulty was relatively even. The scale had good reliability . No differential item functioning was observed across genders for any of the EES-C items, suggesting equitable and unbiased applicability for both male and female respondents. The five-point scoring method of the EES scale was consistent with the overall distribution of the items and subjects. Exercise empowerment was positively correlated with autonomous physical activity and psychological resilience.ConclusionThe results of the study indicate that the EES-C possesses robust psychometric properties, rendering it suitable for application among Chinese college student populations. The adapted version of the EES-C provides a basis for further exploration of the predictive factors of physical activity in Chinese samples. The generalizability of our findings should be further verified in other populations in the future."

Work alienation and psychological distress mediates the relationship between work connectivity behavior after-hours and employees’ time banditry behavior, respectively. In addition, organization-based self-esteem mitigates the positive effects of work connectivity behavior after-hours on work alienation and psychological distress, which in turn also moderates the indirect effects of work connectivity behavior after-hours on employees’ time banditry behavior through work alienation and psychological distress, respectively. This study provides practical guidance for organizations to reduce employee time banditry behavior and human resource management practices in the new technological environment."

Prior research has predominantly focused on positive or negative emotions based on prospect theory, such as anxiety, anger, disgust, and depression. However, there has been relatively little research on how sadness affects individuals’ preferences for immediate and future rewards.MethodsIn this study, college students are recruited as participants, and their emotions are primed with a video before engaging in an intertemporal task. Covariance analysis and logit regression model are established to examine the main and interactive effects of sadness on individuals’ immediate reward preferences.ResultsThe findings reveal that sadness led individuals to prefer smaller immediate rewards, demonstrating a more myopic behavioral pattern, but didn’t affect time discount rate. As the reward baseline increases, sadness’s impact on immediate reward preferences is more pronounced, exacerbating individuals’ myopic behavior.DiscussionIn conclusion, these findings underscore the importance of considering emotional states in economic decision-making models and suggest avenues for future research to explore the complex dynamics of emotions and intertemporal choices."

However, traditional self-report measures of WTP are susceptible to many reporting biases, including tactical responding or an inability to make accurate estimates. Importantly, appraisals also occur automatically and implicit measures used to capture automatic appraisals are less susceptible to the sort of reporting biases that self-report measures can be affected by. However, the only existing implicit measure for assessing automatic price appraisals is impractical because of the large number of trials and time it requires. Accordingly, here we introduce the Implicit Attribute Classification Task , test its effectiveness for the measurement of automatic price appraisals , and directly compare its effectiveness and utility with that of the TRC . We find that the IMPACT is an efficient measure of automatic price appraisals, that it produces considerably larger effects compared to the TRC, and that it does so while substantially shortening the procedure. We also discuss how the IMPACT scores can be used to derive an implicit measure of willingness to pay. Our findings make a substantial contribution to both research and practice by providing an effective tool that facilitates, for the first time, an efficient exploration of implicit WTP."

Additionally, model fitting results indicated that children showed the most significant improvement in recognizing expressions of disgust, closely followed by fear. Conversely, recognition of expressions of happiness and sadness showed slower improvement across different age groups. Regarding gender differences, girls exhibited a more pronounced advantage. Further model fitting revealed that boys showed more pronounced improvements in recognizing expressions of disgust, fear, and anger, while girls showed more pronounced improvements in recognizing expressions of surprise, sadness, and happiness.

However, in recent years, a phenomenon called “ugly-cute” has emerged, challenging the conventional standards of beauty by embracing a form of “ugliness” to enhance its appeal. The reasons and mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain largely unexplored so far. This study aims to investigate the role of emotions, such as pleasure, humor, and surprise, in the relationship between ugly-cute characteristics and attractiveness. The findings reveal that general beauty directly generates attractiveness by eliciting pleasurable emotions, whereas ugly-cute memes achieve attractiveness by inducing pleasurable emotions through the mediation of humor. Furthermore, while both “ugly” and “ugly-cute” memes evoke a sense of surprise, that elicited by ugly-cute memes is accompanied by a humorous response, thereby enhancing their attractiveness, whereas the “ugly” memes fail to evoke humor and lack attractiveness.

This promotion may stem from information processing, and specifically from information elaboration. Information elaboration leverages diverse task-related information and skills possessed by members, fostering the exchange of diverse perspectives, elaborate discussions, and achieving high team performance. In this context, cognitive diversity, encompassing members’ knowledge, skills, and perspectives, may have a positive impact. However, some previous studies suggest that cognitive diversity can lead to affective conflict and impede information processing. In organizations with highly homogeneous social and cultural backgrounds, cognitive diversity may not be effectively utilized in the information elaboration process, potentially yielding negative effects. Authentic leadership is recognized as a significant contributor to facilitating team processes including information processing, with various studies demonstrating its effectiveness. This study hypothesized that cognitive diversity negatively affects the information elaboration process, while authentic leadership has a positive effect. To test these hypotheses, we employed multilevel structural equation modeling analysis based on data collected from respondents in teams across various industries in Japan. The results showed that cognitive diversity negatively affects information elaboration at the individual level. By contrast, authentic leadership positively affects information elaboration at both individual and team levels. These findings suggest that the effect of cognitive diversity on information processing in the workplace may not always be positive, particularly in a sociocultural context that values homogeneity, as observed in Japanese organizations. This study advances the literature on authentic leadership by validating its effect on information elaboration and provides practical implications for diversity management. Additionally, it underscores the effectiveness of authentic leadership in leveraging team members’ cognitive diversity to facilitate information elaboration."

Our study investigated the impact of COVID- on psychologists’ professional quality of life, psychological symptoms, and work-related stress in Aotearoa, New Zealand .MethodNinety-nine registered psychologists were recruited via NZ professional psychology organizations, representing % of the total workforce. Survey data collected included symptoms of compassion fatigue and satisfaction, psychological symptoms, COVID--related stress and resilience, and professional and personal circumstances during the third year of the pandemic, .ResultsSeventy percent reported that their work stress had increased, and % reported that their caseload intensity had increased during the COVID- pandemic. Psychologists reported receiving little to no additional personal or professional support, while % reported increased personal responsibilities during the pandemic . High rates of compassion fatigue and low resilience were reported. We observed that psychological distress was higher than the community averages before the pandemic and comparable with frontline healthcare professionals. Compassion fatigue was associated with COVID-related stress, psychological distress, years in practice, and more frequent supervision, but not with working with at-risk clients, levels of personal support, or having children at home. Despite these difficulties, high Compassion Satisfaction scores were also reported, with over % indicating they had no intention of leaving the profession in the foreseeable future.ConclusionPsychologists’ compassion fatigue appears to have worsened during the COVID- pandemic, as have their symptoms of psychological distress. Increased workplace and clinical demands, telehealth difficulties, stress relating to the pandemic, inadequate support, and increased personal responsibilities were reported by psychologists. Mental health workforces are not immune to the personal and professional impacts of crises and are at risk of burnout and secondary traumatic stress. We hope that increased awareness and understanding of psychologists’ own difficulties during COVID- can be used to better tackle future crises and support mental health professionals."

However, intriguing findings in the liquor manufacturing industry prompt me to consider the necessity of examining the effects of leader-subordinate EI congruence on flow. Therefore, this article begins with two questions: First, what is the impact of leader-subordinate EI congruence on flow? Second, do two distinct congruent scenarios exhibit significant nuances that differentially influence flow? To answer these questions, this study utilizes polynomial regression and three-dimensional response surface analysis methods. A multi-source and three-phase investigation method was used to collect data from subordinates and leaders in the liquor manufacturing industry. Based on the person-environment fit theory, this study investigates the influence of leader-subordinate EI congruence on flow while considering leader-member exchange as a mediator in these processes. The current study not only demonstrates a positive relationship between leader-subordinate EI congruence and LMX, but also reveals that a high-high EI matching pattern can enhance the favorable dynamics of congruence and yield higher LMX compared to a low-low matching pattern. Furthermore, this study identifies LMX as a mediator in the positive relationship between leader-subordinate EI congruence and flow. Additionally, although the incongruent scenarios are beyond the scope of this study, the findings demonstrate that a high EI subordinate paired with a low EI leader has a more detrimental impact on the LMX than a low EI subordinate paired with a high EI leader.

Several researchers have suggested that multiple signals within the temporal binding window can be integrated into a single coherent experience, such as flashes, beeps, and the McGurk effect. However, there is no evidence that TBW distortion also occurs in group interactions. This study investigates the influence of group size and the degree of task involvement in temporal perception using computer-generated clap sound experiments. Participants listened to the randomly generated clap sounds and evaluated whether they were synchronised. We established three conditions based on different levels of task involvement: low , middle , and high conditions. The varying task involvements reflect how participants interact with the clap sounds, ranging from passive listening in the L condition to actively generating sounds by pressing a key in the M condition, or attempting to synchronise key pressing sounds with the sounds in the H condition. Our experiments show a robust group size effect on TBW, regardless of the different conditions. In other words, as the group size increases, participants perceive the group clap as a single event. Furthermore, we found that the uncertain cause–effect relationship condition shows the highest TBW. Interestingly, the TBW in the rigid cause–effect relationship is the same as that in the no involvement condition . Our results suggest that a widened TBW in collective behaviour may facilitate cohesive action, enabling individuals to adapt to the group in relatively uncertain contexts."

The first experiment revealed that in Korean, sentences arranged in the scrambled OSV order were processed more slowly than those in the canonical SOV order, highlighting a scrambling effect. It also found that sentences with subject topicalization in the SOV order were processed as swiftly as those in the canonical form, whereas sentences with object topicalization in the OSV order were processed with speeds and accuracy comparable to scrambled sentences. However, since topicalization and scrambling in Korean use the same OSV order, independently distinguishing the effects of topicalization is challenging. In contrast, Tongan allows for a clear separation of word orders for topicalization and scrambling, facilitating an independent evaluation of topicalization effects. The second experiment, employing a maze task, confirmed that Tongan’s canonical VSO order was processed more efficiently than the VOS scrambled order, thereby verifying a scrambling effect. The third experiment investigated the effects of both scrambling and topicalization in Tongan, finding that the canonical VSO order was processed most efficiently in terms of speed and accuracy, unlike the VOS scrambled and SVO topicalized orders. Notably, the OVS object-topicalized order was processed as efficiently as the VSO canonical order, while the SVO subject-topicalized order was slower than VSO but faster than VOS. By independently assessing the effects of topicalization apart from scrambling, this study demonstrates that both subject and object topicalization in Tongan facilitate sentence processing, contradicting the predictions based on movement-based anticipation."

Whereas prior research sampled either athletes or coaches, the present study used a dyadic approach to explore the bidirectional influence of passion on affective experiences in coaches and athletes. Using a cross-sectional dyadic design, coach-athlete dyads involved in an individual sport at different competition levels, reported on their passion, need-based, and affective experiences. Both actor effects and partner effects were examined. Furthermore, dyadic mediation models were used to investigate the potential mediating role of need-based experiences in the association between passion and affective experiences. Results unveiled compelling evidence for actor effects, indicating that one’s own harmonious passion was positively related to one’s own more adaptive outcomes and negatively to one’s own more maladaptive outcomes, whereas obsessive passion was positively related to maladaptive outcomes. Further, very limited evidence for partner effects, in which coaches’ passion affected athletes’ outcomes or vice versa, was found. The dyadic mediation models underscored the role of need-based experiences in mediating the association between passion and affective experiences, but only at the intrapersonal level. As such, one’s own passion experiences were related to one’s own need-based experiences, which in turn were related to one’s own affective experiences. The study provided no evidence for interpersonal mediation effects."

The training of tactical gaze control and visual attention, and its positive impact on efficient shoot/don’t shoot decisions in police cadets’ use of firearms has recently been demonstrated. On this basis, we designed an individual videobased police firearms training that was grounded on the Four-Component Instructional Design Model . We shifted toward an individual blended learning approach where we applied an intervention training focused on situational awareness, tactical gaze control, and visual attention. In a preregistered lab experiment, N = senior police officers were randomly allocated to the intervention training or an active control training that resembled a traditional police firearms training. Both groups watched a self-produced educational video before proceeding to the practical training in our indoor firing range. In a pre- and post-test, they engaged in realistic shoot/don’t shoot video scenarios. Both groups did very well regarding decision-making, the optimal muzzle position, and the tactical conduct to keep both eyes open before shooting. Although both groups performed on a comparable level in the pre-test’s shoot scenarios, the intervention group significantly improved their response times and time until the first hit. Overall, we were able to provide an adapted, didactically based police firearms training that supplements current standards. We demonstrated that experts are still susceptible to innovative training concepts and therefore substantiate the recommendation to devote more attention to approaches that emphasize the importance of situational awareness, tactical gaze control, and visual attention in police firearms training."

The final sample size was N = for Switzerland and N = for Vietnam. Hierarchical cluster analyses followed by K-means cluster analyses revealed five distinct clusters in both countries.ResultsThree clusters were common to both countries: meat lovers , proactive consumers and suggestible consumers . Two were specific to each country, namely traditional and basic consumers in Switzerland and confident and anxious consumers in Vietnam.ConclusionRelying on voluntary actions, nudging techniques, private initiatives and consumers’ sense of responsibility will certainly be useful but will nevertheless be insufficient to achieve a planetary health diet within the given timeframe . Governments will have no choice but to activate all levers within their sphere of influence – including regulatory measures – and oblige private sector actors to commit to the measures imposed on them.

There are a few studies conducted on student pianists’ experiences with PRMD, but none have been conducted in the Chinese context. Given the distinctive characteristics of higher music education in China and Chinese piano students, this study aims to investigate the lived experiences of tertiary student pianists with PRMD.MethodsPhenomenology is the most suitable qualitative method for investigating lived experiences. This study employed a transcendental phenomenological approach to investigate the experiences of student pianists, collecting data through one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions. Since phenomenological research emphasizes the homogeneity of research subjects, all participants in this study are tertiary student pianists from seven Chinese higher education institutions.ResultsFour themes and ten sub-themes were identified in this study. They are as follows: Theme one, Perceptions of PRMD, with sub-themes of body perceptions, negative thought, and emotional changes; Theme two, Complex Identity, with sub-themes of future pianists’ identity, nuanced identity of student pianists, and the dual identity between student pianist and patient; Theme three, Coping Strategies, with sub-themes of self-regulation and actively seek help from social relations; Theme four, Influences and Meanings, with sub-themes of negative influences of PRMD and positive meanings of PRMD.ConclusionThis study explores the experiences of tertiary student pianists with PRMD, including their subjective thoughts and feelings.

At present, the differences in prolonged grief disorder symptoms among various individuals and how those symptoms relate to cognitive variables are unclear. In the present study, Chinese college students with bereavement experience were selected as participants. Based on the evaluation results of their irrational beliefs, bereavement-related irrational beliefs, basic world assumptions, and PGD symptoms, an individual-centered latent profile analysis was used to divide a group with PGD symptoms into several subgroups and comprehensively examine the relationships between these subgroups and cognitive variables. The severity of PGD symptoms among Chinese college students can be categorized into three subgroups: mild, moderate, and severe. Cognitive variables such as irrational beliefs and basic world assumptions were all found to correlate with the severity of PGD symptoms; bereavement-related irrational beliefs was the variable with the largest correlation.

Previous studies have suggested that auditory beat stimulation may represent a method enabling a reduction of MW. However, little is known about how different auditory stimulation conditions are subjectively perceived and whether this perception is in turn related to changes in subjective states, behavioral measures of attention and MW. In the present study, we therefore investigated MW under auditory beat stimulation and control conditions using experience sampling during a sustained attention to response task . The subjective perception of the stimulation conditions, as well as changes in anxiety, stress and negative mood after versus before stimulation were assessed via visual-analog scales. Results showed that any auditory stimulation applied during the SART was perceived as more distracting, disturbing, uncomfortable and tiring than silence and was related to more pronounced increases of stress and negative mood. Importantly, the perception of the auditory conditions as disturbing was directly correlated with MW propensity. Additionally, distracting, disturbing and uncomfortable perceptions predicted negative mood. In turn, negative mood was inversely correlated with response accuracy for target stimuli, a behavioral indicator of MW. In summary, our data show that MW and attentional performance are affected by the adverse perception of auditory stimulation, and that this influence may be mediated by changes in mood."

In addition, the study delved deeper into the dimensions of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal concerning the impact of event, examining their roles in coping style, anxiety, and fear of missing out. Results showed that: The impact of event could predict the fear of missing out positively. A more positive coping style is negatively associated with anxiety. A chain mediation effect of coping style and anxiety is observed in the path from hyperarousal and avoidance to the fear of missing out. In contrast to the hyperarousal or avoidance, the path from intrusion to the fear of missing out is mediated by anxiety but not coping style.

To understand some of the implications of stress on cyberloafing, we can distinguish between stress perceived as an obstacle that can be overcome – challenge stress – or as a threat that can block work performance – obstacle stress – and stress perceived as an obstacle that can be overcome – challenge stress – or as a threat that can block work performance – obstacle stress-. The aim of this research is to find out the relationships between challenge-obstacle stress in Cyberloafing, as well as the moderating effect of Smartphone Addiction and Maladaptive. In this study, the Challenge-Hindrance Stressors, Smartphone addiction scale-short version instrument, the Maladaptive subscale of the Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire and Cyberloafing were applied to upper-level vocational training students from different secondary schools in all provinces of the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain, distributed throughout the provinces that make up this autonomous community. The findings show that students’ challenge stressors do not increase Cyberloafing, enabling them to cope with the academic demands and work challenges during the theory and internship period. On the contrary, obstacle stressors generate stressful situations that undermine the acquisition of objectives and development of academic competences. In our research we observe that challenge-obstacle stressors have a disparate influence on cyberloafing. Challenge stressors are negatively related to Maladaptive.

This may result in physical and cognitive load for the user. Understanding how lower extremity loading affects cognitive-motor interference is crucial for the design of wearable devices, including powered exoskeletons, and the development of effective training interventions.ObjectiveThis study aims to examine the effects of modified leg mechanics on cognitive-motor interference in dual-task walking. Gait variability, as an indicator of motor control, was analyzed to investigate its relation to cognitive task difficulty and to determine whether lower extremity loading modifies this relationship. Additionally, the impact on the gait pattern, as represented by the mean values of spatio-temporal gait parameters were investigated.MethodFifteen healthy young adults walked on a treadmill with and without weight cuffs bilaterally attached to their thighs and shanks while performing a visual-verbal Stroop test and a serial subtraction task . Dependent variables include mean values and variability of step length, step width, stride time and double support time. Additionally, secondary task performance as correct response rates and perceived workload were assessed.ResultsDouble support time variability decreased during dual-task walking, but not during walking with modified leg mechanics while performing the difficult secondary task. Walking with modified leg mechanics resulted in increased gait variability compared to normal walking, regardless of cognitive load. During walking with modified leg mechanics, step length, step width, and stride time increased, while double support time decreased. The secondary tasks did not affect the gait pattern.ConclusionThe interplay between an external focus of attention and competition for attentional resources may influence the variability of double support time. The findings suggest that walking with modified leg mechanics could increase cognitive-motor interference for healthy young adults in demanding dual-task situations. Therefore, it is important to analyze the underlying mechanisms of cognitive-motor interference in the context of human-exoskeleton interaction."

For some fans, watching alone at home may have been enough, but concert-concurrent surges of social media activity suggest many virtual performance attendees are doing more. To understand why fans would turn their attention from these precious performance streams to social media, we explored Twitter engagement during four live streamed concerts performed by the Kpop group BTS in . In public Tweets sampled by either concert hashtag or a predefined stream of users and keywords, we evaluated patterns in posting rates in relation to concert program events and investigated the content patterns in , Tweets sampled from four ranges of popularity . Across concerts, short “Shout” Tweets surged at the start of songs, while the rate of retweets often fell during musical performances and shot up when BTS was off stage. Content analysis on the subsample found the materials most widely shared were informational or featured concert visuals, mimicking how fans use their phones at in-person concerts. Most original posts received few Retweets and were more personal and expressive of admiration for the performers. Comparison between the samples also suggests users were strategic in using or omitting official concert hashtags with the strongest differences in the most widely disseminated content. Postings on Twitter during these performances seemed principally directed to fellow fans and audience members, by individuals choosing to share their own excitement and check in with others.

Mandarin-native speakers could easily pick up novel words with Mandarin tones after a short exposure, but English-native speakers had specific difficulty with the tonal components. It is, however, unclear how much experience with Mandarin is needed to successfully use the tonal cue in word learning. In this study, we explored this question by focusing on the heritage language population, who typically are exposed to the target language at an early age but then develop and switch to another majority language. Specifically, we investigated whether heritage Mandarin speakers residing in an English-speaking region and speaking English as a dominant language would be able to learn novel Mandarin tonal words from statistical tracking. It helps us understand whether early exposure to the target feature is sufficient to promote the use of that feature in word learning later in life.MethodsWe trained heritage Mandarin speakers with Mandarin pseudowords via a cross-situational statistical word learning task .Results and discussionHeritage Mandarin speakers were able to learn the pseudowords across multiple situations, but similar-sounding words were more difficult to identify, and words that contrast only in lexical tones were distinguished at chance level throughout learning. We also collected information about the participants’ heritage language experience and usage.

Pre-service teachers in education play a vital role in fostering equitable educational practices. This study aimed to measure the association between the social media-based community of inquiry and pre-service teachers’ intentions toward social justice and equity in education. It focused on pre-service teachers enrolled in the education departments of universities in Gilgit Baltistan , Pakistan. Census sampling was used to include all students enrolled in teacher education departments across universities in GB. The research utilized a multi-wave survey design, beginning with a baseline survey to assess pre-service teachers’ presence on social media. This information guided the design of a community of inquiry on social media centered on the theme of social justice and equity in education. After months, a second survey was conducted to measure the association between the community of inquiry and pre-service teachers’ intentions toward social justice and equity. For data analysis, the study employed the partial least squares-consistent structural equation modeling approach. The novelty of the study lies in integrating the community of inquiry framework with the theory of planned behavior. We found a significant and positive association between the social media-based community of inquiry and pre-service teachers’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control regarding their intentions to implement social justice and equity in education. These findings hold the potential for developing prospective teachers and educational leadership with a strong focus on equity. Future research could explore creating a community of inquiry for pre-service teachers to enhance their mindset and skills for inclusive education. This aligns with the broader objective of achieving Sustainable Development Goal on fostering a more inclusive and equitable educational environment."

The act of wearing masks obscures individuals’ facial features and influences their desire for uniqueness. This study aims to explore how wearing masks promotes individual uniqueness- seeking behavior. Three experiments were performed using various product categories and sample types . Experiment results show that wearing masks obscures individuals’ facial features and weakens their self- perceived uniqueness, thereby increasing their willingness to actively purchase unique products. This study is the first to examine the effect of wearing masks on individuals’ choice of unique products.

This study focuses on adapting and scrutinizing the psychometric properties of the German iteration of the Workplace Age Discrimination Scale . Comprehensive Confirmatory Factor Analysis results affirm a robust fit for the unidimensional model. Convergent validity is established through correlations between WADS-G scores and related instruments, while discriminant validity is evidenced by its lack of association with extraversion. Noteworthy findings include a positive correlation with turnover intention and negative correlations with job satisfaction, occupational self-efficacy, and organizational affective commitment. Despite its merits, the predictive efficacy of the WADS-G is notably inferior when juxtaposed with the Workplace Incivility Scale. Its explanatory power for turnover intention is constrained when accounting for variables such as job satisfaction, work environment, neuroticism, and core self-evaluation. Although measurement invariance testing across gender groups reveals scalar to strict measurement invariance, the examination across age groups indicates metric invariance. However, Confirmatory Factor Analyses for the – and + age groups, central to the research emphasis, reveal suboptimal model fit.

If this form of phenotypic bias extends to eyewitness identification tasks, eyewitnesses may be more likely to identify Black suspects with an African rather than European phenotype, regardless of their guilt status. Further, in cases where the witness’s description of the perpetrator does not contain phenotypic information, phenotypic mismatch between the suspect and the other lineup members may bias identification decisions toward or against the suspect. If witnesses can use elements of the lineup construction to guide their identification decisions rather than relying on their recognition memory, then the lineup should be deemed unfair due to suspect bias. The current study also investigated lineup presentation method as a procedural safeguard, predicting that that when lineups were presented simultaneously, there would be a significant two-way interaction of phenotypic bias and lineup composition, with a larger simple main effect of phenotypic bias when lineups were suspect-biased than when all lineup members shared the same phenotype. We expected that this interaction would be significantly smaller or non-significant for sequential lineups.MethodsParticipants watched a mock crime video that contained a Black culprit with either a more African phenotype or a less African phenotype before attempting identifications from a photo array that contained a suspect whose phenotype always matched the culprit viewed in the video, but varied in culprit-presence, phenotypic match of the suspect and fillers, and presentation method.ResultsParticipants did not identify Black suspects with Afrocentric features more often than Black suspects with Eurocentric features. However, witnesses made more identifications of suspects when the fillers did not match the suspect’s phenotype compared to when all lineup members possessed similar phenotypic features.DiscussionIn sum, phenotypic bias did not influence our participant-witnesses’ identification decisions, nor interact with lineup composition and lineup presentation type to affect identifications of suspects, suggesting that phenotypic bias may be less influential in match-to-memory tasks than other types of legal decision-making . However, the suggestiveness created by failing to match fillers’ phenotypes to the suspect’s phenotype can be avoided with proper attention to fair lineup construction."

The recovery effects from different horticultural activities were similar across physiological indicators, although flower arrangement and sowing and transplanting seeds exhibited relatively robust recovery benefits. The heart rate and α-EEG-based generalized estimating equation revealed that horticultural activities offered significantly better relative recovery at each time phase of operation than the reference activity, with girls showing a .% higher relative recovery value than boys.

Past research has examined interpersonal or intrapersonal factors involved in chronic pain. However, to enhance our understanding of CLBP’s biopsychosocial underpinnings, more empirical integration of both intra- and interpersonal factors involved in CLBP is needed. Thus, our study examined the independent and joint associations of insecure attachment dimensions and ER strategies with CLBP severity and interference.MethodsWe recruited US adults with CLBP through Prolific Academic, an online participant pool. Participants from Prolific Academic were eligible for the study if they were at least years of age, resided in the US, reported CLBP at least half the days over the past months , and used prescribed pain medication for their CLBP. Data collection was between November and February . Eligible participants filled out a Qualtrics survey which consisted of measures assessing insecure attachment dimensions, ER strategies, as well as demographical information. Outcome variables in the present study were CLBP severity and interference. We ran multiple linear regression models to examine the associations between ER strategies and insecure attachment dimensions as predictors, and CLBP severity or interference as predicted variables, after controlling for sex as a covariate; we also conducted moderation analyses to investigate the interactions between ER strategies and insecure attachment dimensions when testing associations with CLBP severity or interference.ResultsOur results indicated that, after controlling for ER strategies, anxious attachment was positively associated with CLBP interference but not pain severity ; avoidant attachment was not associated with CLBP interference or severity . After adjusting for anxious and avoidant attachment, emotional expression and expressive suppression were positively associated with CLBP severity but not interference . Furthermore, emotional expression was associated with CLBP severity and interference at low and medium levels of avoidant attachment ; expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal did not interact with attachment dimensions when examining CLBP severity or interference .ConclusionOur study shows that anxious attachment may be an interpersonal risk factor related to CLBP, above and beyond intrapersonal ERs, as anxious attachment was associated with higher levels of pain interference. Furthermore, emotional expression was associated with increased CLBP severity and interference, particularly among individuals at low and medium levels of avoidant attachment. Existing studies on chronic pain have mostly focused on examining intrapersonal or interpersonal correlates in isolation. The present study extends our understanding of CLBP by considering the role of interpersonal factors , in combination with intrapersonal ER strategies. Given the correlational nature of the present study, longitudinal studies are needed to establish causality between psychosocial correlates and CLBP symptoms. Ultimately, we hope our integrated approach will facilitate the development of treatments and interventions tailored to address patients’ attachment-related needs, enhancing the management and maintenance of CLBP among patients."

Here, we investigate whether increased communication difficulty caused by additional background noise, hearing impairment, and not providing adequate hearing-aid processing affected the dynamics of a group conversation between one hearing-impaired and two normal-hearing interlocutors. Free conversations were recorded from triads communicating at low or high levels of canteen noise. In conversations at low noise levels, the HI interlocutor was either unaided or aided. In conversations at high noise levels, the HI interlocutor either experienced omnidirectional or directional sound processing. Results showed that HI interlocutors generally spoke more and initiated their turn faster, but with more variability, than the NH interlocutors. Increasing the noise level resulted in generally higher speech levels, but more so for the NH than for the HI interlocutors. Higher background noise also affected the HI interlocutors’ ability to speak in longer turns. When the HI interlocutors were unaided at low noise levels, both HI and NH interlocutors spoke louder, while receiving directional sound processing at high levels of noise only reduced the speech level of the HI interlocutor. In conclusion, noise, hearing impairment, and hearing-aid processing mainly affected speech levels, while the remaining measures of conversational dynamics were unaffected. Hence, although experiencing large changes in communication difficulty, the conversational dynamics of the free triadic conversations remain relatively stable."

At the same time, cognitive decline is a well-documented phenomenon accompanying the aging process. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that aging can also be related to positive processes that allow one to compensate for the decline. These processes include the compensatory brain activity of older adults primarily investigated using fMRI and PET. To strengthen the cognitive interpretation of compensatory brain activity in older adults, we searched for its indicators in brain activity measured by EEG.MethodsThe study sample comprised volunteers, including older adults and young adults who performed -back, -back, and -back tasks while recording the EEG signal. The study analyzed the level of cognitive performance, including sensitivity index, the percentage of correct answers to the target, and the percentage of false alarm errors; theta and alpha power for electrodes located in the frontal-midline and the centro-parietal areas.ResultsCognitive performance was worse in older adults than in young adults, which manifested in a significantly lower sensitivity index and a significantly higher false alarm error rate at all levels of the n-back task difficulty. Simultaneously, performance worsened with increasing task difficulty regardless of age. Significantly lower theta power in the older participants was observed at all difficulty levels, even at the lowest one, where compensatory activity was expected. At the same time, at this difficulty level, cognitive performance was worse in older adults than in young adults, which could reduce the chances of observing compensatory brain activity. The significant decrease in theta power observed in both age groups with rising task difficulty can reflect a declining capacity for efficient cognitive functioning under increasing demands rather than adapting to this increase. Moreover, in young adults, alpha power decreased to some extent with increasing cognitive demand, reflecting adaptation to them, while in older adults, no analogous pattern was observed.DiscussionIn conclusion, based on the results of the current study, the presence of compensatory activity in older adults cannot be inferred."

Due to its links to psychopathology and high-risk behaviors, difficulty in emotion regulation frequently serves as a transdiagnostic dimension. This cross-sectional study used a person-centered analytical approach to identify groups of Portuguese university students with similar profiles of emotion regulation difficulties and describe how these groups differ in their presentation of repetitive negative thinking, internet addiction, and subjective wellbeing. The analyses identified four latent profiles: .% of students showed global dysregulation , % were moderately dysregulated with elevated problems in goal-directed behavior , % showed specific difficulties with low emotional awareness and clarity , and .% showed adaptive emotion regulation . As anticipated, the Low Emotion Regulation Profile had the lowest subjective wellbeing and the highest prevalence of repetitive negative thinking and internet addiction. Students with a Low Insight Profile also showed low subjective wellbeing, but less repetitive negative thinking compared to the Low Emotion Regulation Profile.

Considering that vegans and vegetarians often share similar motives for their lifestyle choices, namely animal and environmental issues, the question arises why similar motives lead to different conclusions and correspondingly different behaviors, most notably, of course, that vegetarians consume animal-derived foods such as cheese or milk while vegans do not consume animal-derived products . This is why this study explored the psychological differences between vegans, vegetarians, and prospective vegans – the latter group being located in an intermediate, transitionary position. Focusing on the motivational, affective and cognitive components of dietary transition and participants’ adherence to eating patterns, reasons for said patterns, possible hinderances to becoming vegan, the role of participants’ social environments, and the impact of various misconceptions regarding the feasibility of a vegan diet in everyday life were all explored.MethodsAn observational study was conducted via online questionnaire .ResultsSignificant differences were found between vegans, prospective vegans, and vegetarians, especially concerning their knowledge of issues pertaining to their respective lifestyles.DiscussionThe critical role of knowledge is invoked as an explanation as to why vegans and vegetarians display different behaviors although they share a similar motivation.

Both this questionnaire and use of language assessment in Basque are needed in the Basque Country, where multilingualism is well attested. The questionnaire was developed after the PaBiQ with additional questions meant to reflect the Basque context, notably its schooling linguistic model. The HEGA was administered to the parents of bilingual children of the Northern Basque Country whose language skills in Basque were assessed via a new test battery targeting different linguistic domains . Several significant correlations were found between exposure to, and use of Basque and performance in lexical and morphosyntactic production and comprehension. Mixed-effect regression analyses revealed that language experience in Basque, and particularly the fact of being schooled entirely in Basque, were strong predictors of lexical and morphosyntactic outcomes. In contrast, phonological performance, as measured by nonword repetition, appeared to be less impacted by language experience in Basque. Finally, two children were identified as being at risk of language impairment, due to low language performance in Basque despite extended language experience. These results have important implications for clinicians and educators, in particular for detecting language difficulties in Basque-speaking bilingual children. They also show the need for assessing language abilities in Basque for children growing up in a solid Basque-speaking environment."

Though previous studies have investigated reading comprehension difficulties in ASD and highlighted factors that contribute to these difficulties, this evidence has mainly stemmed from children with ASD and intact cognitive skills. Also, much emphasis has been placed on the relation between reading comprehension and word recognition skills, while the role of other skills, including fluency and morphosyntax, remains underexplored. This study addresses these gaps by investigating reading comprehension in two groups of school-aged children with ASD, one with intact and one with low cognitive abilities, also exploring the roles of word decoding, fluency and morphosyntax in each group’s reading comprehension performance.MethodsThe study recruited children with ASD and low cognitive abilities, and age-matched children with ASD and intact cognitive skills. The children were assessed on four reading subdomains, namely, decoding, fluency, morphosyntax, and reading comprehension.ResultsThe children with ASD and low cognitive abilities scored significantly lower than their peers with intact cognitive abilities in all reading subdomains, except for decoding, verb production and compound word formation. Regression analyses showed that reading comprehension in the group with ASD and intact cognitive abilities was independently driven by their decoding and fluency skills, and to a lesser extent, by morphosyntax. On the other hand, the children with ASD and low cognitive abilities mainly drew on their decoding, and to a lesser extent, their morphosyntactic skills to perform in reading comprehension.DiscussionThe results suggest that reading comprehension was more strongly affected in the children with ASD and low cognitive abilities as compared to those with intact cognitive skills. About half of the children with ASD and intact cognitive skills also exhibited mild-to-moderate reading comprehension difficulties, further implying that ASD may influence reading comprehension regardless of cognitive functioning. Finally, strengths in decoding seemed to predominantly drive cognitively-impaired children’s reading performance, while the group with ASD and intact cognitive skills mainly recruited fluency and metalinguistic lexical skills to cope with reading comprehension demands, further suggesting that metalinguistic awareness may be a viable way to enhance reading comprehension in ASD."

This concept has significantly influenced contemporary studies on the transition to adulthood. Study explains that psychosocial developmental tasks involve shifts in an individual's psychological state and social relationships, potentially disrupting their previous equilibrium. Authors stress the importance of forming personal identity and fostering a healthy sense of independence, especially concerning identity and autonomy tasks, as crucial elements for adolescent wellbeing analysis. In line with this, the study focuses on the concurrent and predictive relationship between identity process of commitment, emotional autonomy, and psychological wellbeing among adolescents. Four hundred fifty-four participants with an age ranged from to years completed surveys measuring emotional autonomy, identity commitment, and psychological wellbeing. The findings revealed that both emotional autonomy and identity commitment predicted psychological wellbeing, but in different ways. The study revealed that emotional autonomy is inversely associated with psychological wellbeing in middle and late adolescents, indicating that their ability to establish independence from their parents or relinquish unrealistic parental expectations may be linked to a decline in their mental health. The results also indicated that identity commitment is moderately and positively related to psychological wellbeing, suggesting that when adolescents have a clear sense of their identity, they may experience greater wellbeing. This finding underscores the importance of encouraging adolescents to explore their values, interests, and goals, as well as providing them with support and guidance throughout the process. Additionally, the findings of the study revealed that emotional autonomy has a negative influence on psychological wellbeing when identity commitment is low or average. Specifically, when individuals have a low level of identity commitment, emotional autonomy significantly predicts lower psychological wellbeing. Similarly, when identity commitment is at an average level, emotional autonomy also has a detrimental effect on psychological wellbeing. Lastly, the study revealed that when individuals have a high level of identity commitment, emotional autonomy does not have a significant impact on psychological wellbeing. In simpler terms, when individuals possess a strong sense of commitment to their identity, their level of emotional autonomy does not play a significant role in influencing their psychological wellbeing."

Furthermore, we implemented a study in a ×× design with the factors information format , visualization type , and context . Additionally, all four “joint questions” ,P,P,P) were asked for. The main factor of interest was whether there is a format effect in the five visualization types named above. Surprisingly, the advantage of natural frequencies was not found for joint probabilities and, most strikingly, the format interacted with the visualization type. Specifically, while people’s understanding of joint probabilities in a double tree seems to be worse than the understanding of the corresponding natural frequencies , the opposite seems to be true in the × table. Hence, the advantage of natural frequencies compared to probabilities in typical Bayesian tasks cannot be found in the same way when joint probability or frequency tasks are asked."

We prepared a questionnaire with questions on sociodemographic aspects and individuals’ points of view toward the lockdown. We sent a link for the survey through social media and encouraged participants to also share the link in their respective social networks, as a snowball sample. Cluster analysis was performed to identify different opinion profiles. Cluster Analysis is a multivariate approach that aims to segment a set of data into distinct groups, using some classification criteria.ResultsFrom April to May , the link received , free participations via social networks from all over Brazil. We analyzed data from , participants. Pro-lockdown opinions predominated in most of the sociodemographic strata. Cluster analysis identified two groups: pro-lockdown, aligned with the scientific recommendations, and anti-lockdown, characterized by economic insecurity and denialism. Anti-lockdown participants downplayed the pandemic’s seriousness and believed in unproven measures to fight SARS-CoV-. However, these same participants were afraid of losing their jobs and of being unable to pay their bills. In general, participants did not believe in the feasibility of a lockdown in Brazil or in the efficacy of the prevailing government administration’s measures.ConclusionThe study identified a lack of consensus among participants concerning lockdown as a practice. Issues such as disbelief in the pandemic’s seriousness, denialism, and economic insecurity were important in the determination of the profiles identified in the study. Denialism is believed to have been a subjective defense against the economic problems resulting from social control measures and the lack of adequate social policies to deal with the pandemic. It was also highlighted that political polarization and the lack of central coordination during social distancing are crucial aspects. The variation in results in different locations highlights the diversity of the Brazilian scenario.

This study focusses on the centrality of gendered inequality and oppression as a factor that shapes not only women’s experience in the military but also their responses in cases of excessive violence. The goal of this study was to explore the ways women veterans of combat or combat-support units conceptualize their stance regarding violent acts which they either committed or witnessed in war zones. Using a qualitative approach, we analyzed the retrospective testimonies of Israeli women veterans from the archives of an NGO that documents veteran combatants exposure to excessive violence. Most women explained their violent acts as inherent to the military system and culture, which in our analysis was categorized as examples of either internalized gender oppression or as identification with the aggressor. A smaller number of women described their attempts to protest, as they took a moral stance rooted in a feminine perspective. The three explanations revealed through the analysis of the testimonies reflect the inner tension experienced by many women in the military, as they navigate between two extreme positions, either as victims of male dominance, or as aggressors that are part of a powerful military system. In this study, gendered inequality provides a framework for analyzing the data. Thus, this study contributes to the theoretical knowledge and methodological approaches concerning violent situations in combat areas, focusing on the various ways in which women veterans subjectively and retroactively conceptualize their participation in and responses to violent acts."

In the treatment group, male participants watched VIDS videos that portrayed a woman getting gender prejudiced and female participants watched VIDS videos showing a man receiving gender biased treatment in the society. The videos presented to treatment group consisted of one narrative and one expert video from VIDS, which stimulate emotional and logical understanding of the another gender, respectively. Participants in the control group watched a control video that was irrelevant to gender bias. All participants then answered gender bias questionnaire, as well as cultural orientation questionnaire.ResultsCultural orientation as a covariance, ANCOVA revealed participants in the treatment group showed significantly lower gender bias than the control group.

To answer our research questions, we collected controlled yet ecologically valid speech by applying an innovative recording paradigm. Participants were asked to perform an interactive reading task in collaboration with an interlocutor remotely via video calls. Results indicate that information status is encoded paradigmatically via the F contour, while syntagmatic effects are subtle and depend on the acoustic parameter used. Individual speakers differ primarily in their strength of encoding and secondarily in the type of parameters employed.

Participants also answered questions about their exercise habits and the coping strategies they adopted during lockdown.ResultsThe results suggest that runners who saw the largest reductions in time spent exercising during lockdown tended to feel significantly less energetic and friendly . In addition, they recorded significantly lower scores in marital satisfaction with their peers . The runners with a higher degree of dependence on physical exercise registered significantly higher levels of depression, tension and anger than non-dependent runners . Runners whose partners were physically active and did not have children had significantly higher scores marital satisfaction than runners whose partners were not physically active and had children .DiscussionThese findings seem to indicate that the psychological approach to athletes in the context of crises such as the pandemic should consider not only individual aspects, but also include the family perspective."

The current study investigates the hypothesis according to which the perception of object shadows would predict the perception of body shadows. participants aged years on average were immersed into a virtual reality environment and instructed to perceive and indicate the coincidence or non coincidence between the movement of a ball shadow with regard to ball movement on the one hand, and between their body shadow and their body position in space on the other. Their brain activity was recording via a -channel EEG system, in which beta oscillations were analyzed. A series of Multiple Regression Analysis revealed that the beta dynamic oscillations patterns of the bilateral occipito-parieto-frontal pathway associated with the perception of ball shadow appeared to be a significant predictor of the increase in beta oscillations across frontal areas related to the body shadow perception and the decrease in beta oscillations across frontal areas connected to the decision making of the body shadow. Taken together, the findings suggest that inferential thinking ability relative to body shadow would be reliably predicted from object shadows and that the bilateral beta oscillatory modulations would be indicative of the formation of predictive neural frontal assemblies, which encode and infer body shadow neural representation, that is, a substitution of the physical body."

Compare the demographic data, -item Hamilton Depression Scale , -item Toronto Alexithymia Scale , Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form , and Body Investment Scale scores between two groups. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors contributing to NSSI behaviors in adolescents with depression, and establish four predictive models. Based on the models’ predictive probability, the ROC curves were plotted to calculate the value of the predictive diagnostic effect.ResultsThe group without NSSI had lower scores than the group with NSSI on HAMD- total score, TAS- total score, difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and externally focused thinking, as well as lower scores on CTQ-SF total score, physical neglect, emotional neglect, physical abuse, and emotional abuse. In contrast, the BIS total score, body image feelings and attitudes, body care, and body protection factor scores were higher for the group without NSSI. The BIS body care factor score and the CTQ-SF emotional abuse factor score were significantly linked with adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorder who exhibited NSSI behaviors. These results provide a good diagnostic model for adolescents with depressive disorder.ConclusionLow levels of body care and childhood emotional abuse may independently contribute to the implementation of NSSI in adolescents with depressive disorder. Body investment and childhood trauma are valuable in diagnosing and predicting NSSI behaviors and should be considered as potentially important factors in clinical treatment."

Study shows that COVID- implicit theories detected in the Pre-study were activated as independent factors that constitute people’s interpretations of the virus origin. These beliefs were related to a lesser intention to engage in preventive behaviours and a higher level of mistrust in institutional information, although some beliefs generate positive expectations about COVID- consequences. In Study , conducted with a different sample, official COVID- information was included as an independent variable, but this new variable did not further explain results. Lastly, Study consisting of both previous samples confirmed that conspiracy beliefs had a direct effect on a lesser willingness to engage in preventive actions, a higher mistrust, and positive expectations about COVID- consequences.

In empirical research, self-affirmation often involves recalling personal values, strengths, or relationships to restore moral integrity. Research shows it improves attitude adjustment, resolves cognitive dissonance, and enhances well-being. Some studies stress the importance of distinguishing between different aspects of self-affirmation, like strengths or social relations. These aspects align with concepts in psychotherapy that differentiate between internal and external resource activation, benefiting health, self-esteem, and resilience. The aim of the current study was twofold: first, to independently test the three-factor structure of the Spontaneous Self-affirmation Measure , and second, to integrate self-affirmation strategies into a broader resource activation framework as resilience factors. It also examined associations with self-esteem and effects of age, gender, and education on spontaneous self-affirmation.Methods, participants were recruited online. The original three-factor structure of the SSAM was examined using structural equation modeling. Further, a theory driven two-factor structure applying an internal and external resources framework was examined, integrating the factors of the SSAM into the taxonomy of resource activation .ResultsThe results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that both the original three-factor structure and the complementary two-factor structure with an Internal resources and External resources factor fit the data appropriately. All three factors of the original factor model showed a high reliability . We also found measurement invariance across age, gender, and education. Furthermore, group differences regarding gender, education and ethnicity in the utilization of spontaneous self-affirmation strategies were apparent.

This egocentric tendency is often categorized as a bias of attribution, with favorable self-evaluation resulting from differing explanations of one’s own behavior and that of others. However, studies on information availability in social contexts offer an alternative explanation, ascribing egocentric biases to the inherent informational asymmetries between performing an action and merely observing it. Since biases of attribution and availability often co-exist and interact with each other, it is not known whether they are both necessary for the egocentric biases to emerge. In this study, we used a design that allowed us to directly compare the contribution of these two distinct sources of bias to judgements about the difficulty of an effortful task. Participants exhibited no attribution bias as judgements made for themselves did not differ from those made for others. Importantly, however, participants perceived the tasks they actively performed to be harder than the tasks they observed, and this bias was magnified as the overall task difficulty increased. These findings suggest that information asymmetries inherent to the difference between actively performing a task and observing it can drive egocentric biases in effort evaluations on their own and without a contribution from biases of attribution."

We also examined brain activity using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner in order to understand the underlying neural mechanisms. Healthy university students viewed the facial images of older and younger individuals and judged the humanness of each individual in terms of agency and experience while inside the MRI scanner. The results indicated that older adults were rated higher on experience, and no difference was found in ratings for agency between younger and older face images. Analysis of brain imaging data indicated that positive functional connectivity between the ventral and dorsal regions of the medial prefrontal cortex was greater when judging the humanness of younger faces than older faces. We also found that the negative functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and postcentral gyrus was greater when judging the humanness of older faces as compared to that of younger faces. Although the current study did not show distinct brain activities related to humanness perception, it suggests the possibility that different brain connectivities are related to humanness perception regarding targets belonging to different age groups."

As the mouth is known to play a crucial role in decoding emotional expressions, its covering is likely to affect this process. Recent evidence suggests that facial expressions impact behavioral responses only when their emotional content is relevant to subjects’ goals. Thus, this study investigates whether and how masked emotional faces alter such a phenomenon.MethodsForty participants completed two reaching versions of the Go/No-go task in a counterbalanced fashion. In the Emotional Discrimination Task , participants were required to respond to angry, fearful, or happy expressions by performing a reaching movement and withholding it when a neutral face was presented. In the Gender Discrimination Task , the same images were shown, but participants had to respond according to the poser’s gender. The face stimuli were presented in two conditions: covered by a surgical mask or without any covering .ResultsConsistent with previous studies, valence influenced behavioral control in the EDT but not in the GDT. Nevertheless, responses to facial emotions in the EDT exhibited significant differences between unmasked and masked conditions. In the former, angry expressions led to a slowdown in participants’ responses. Conversely, in the masked condition, behavioral reactions were impacted by fearful and, to a greater extent, by happy expressions. Responses to fearful faces were slower, and those to happy faces exhibited increased variability in the masked condition compared to the unmasked condition. Furthermore, response accuracy to masked happy faces dramatically declined compared to the unmasked condition and other masked emotions.DiscussionIn sum, our findings indicate that surgical masks disrupt reactions to emotional expressions, leading people to react less accurately and with heightened variability to happy expressions, provided that the emotional dimension is relevant to people’s goals."

However, its potential connection to adult sexual behavior has largely remained unexplored. Our online survey, primarily distributed among individuals interested in tickle fetishism, explored tickling and its association with sexual behavior. Ticklishness types, tools, preferred body parts, and partner preferences, were examined. Results revealed diverse patterns of ticklishness changes over time and distinct body-part preferences for different types of tickling. Childhood experiences and exposure to tickling content in television were found to shape individuals’ affinity for tickle fetishism. A quarter of respondents reported experiencing orgasms exclusively from tickling, while around % expressed sexual satisfaction through tickling alone, indicating its sufficiency as a sexual stimulus among fetishists. Tickling desire decreased after orgasm, indicating an association between tickling and sexual activity. Moreover, ticklishness degree predicted preferences for being tickled rather than tickling others. Exploratory factor analysis identified three factors underlying tickling and sexual experiences: enjoyment and frequency of tickling during sexual activity; preference for intense sexual experiences; age of becoming sexually active.

However, the boundary conditions of the two have yet to be sufficiently explored, and this article will further explore the moderating effect in the transformation mechanism.MethodsThe convenience sampling method was used to select a cumulative total of students from university students of several universities in Beijing for the study, using questionnaires including Cyberbullying Victimization Questionnaire, Cyberbullying Perpetration Questionnaire, the Callous-unemotional Traits Scale, and Internet Morality Questionnaire.Results Controlling for gender and grade, cyberbullying victimization has a positive relationship with cyberbullying perpetration. Callous-unemotional traits moderated the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and perpetration. Internet morality can moderate the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and perpetration. Callous-unemotional traits and Internet morality can co-regulate the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and perpetration.ConclusionThe results indicate that cyberbullying victimization had a significant positive relationship with cyberbullying perpetration, a process moderated by callous-unemotional traits and Internet morality."

Participants had an immersive experience with a VR interactive platform that provided somatosensory interaction in height stimulation scenes. Psychological scores, behavioral and cognitive performance, and physiological responses were recorded and analyzed. The results indicated that the intervention group had significantly lower fear scores compared to the control group. Analysis of heart rate variability revealed that the intervention group exhibited improved heart rate variability, indicating enhanced cardiovascular function and emotion regulation. The behavioral and cognitive results demonstrated that the intervention group exhibited higher left eye openness, faster reaction times, and greater movement distance, suggesting enhanced attentional focus, cognitive processing, and reduced avoidance behaviors. These findings suggest that TEAS at PC can effectively reduce fear and improve the regulation of physiological and behavioral responses to negative emotional stimuli."

Mocking enactments are a prime example of such complex social actions as they are layered both interactionally and stance-related, and they rely significantly on the use of bodily visual resources, depicting rather than describing events and stances. Using Du Bois’ Stance Triangle as a framework, this study investigates mocking enactments as a case study to unravel the multimodal aspects of layered stance expressions. Drawing on three data sets—music instruction in Dutch, German, and English, spontaneous face-to-face interactions among friends in Dutch, and narrations on past events in Flemish Sign Language —this study provides a qualitative exploration of mocking enactments across different communicative settings, languages, and modalities. The study achieves three main objectives: illuminating how enactments are used for mocking, identifying the layers of stance-taking at play, and examining the multimodal construction of mocking enactments. Our analysis reveals various different uses of enactments for mocking. Aside from enacting the target of the mockery, participants can include other characters and viewpoints, highlighting the breadth of the phenomenon under scrutiny. Second, we uncover the layered construction of stance on all axes of the Stance Triangle . Third, we find that mocking enactments are embedded in highly evaluative contexts, indexed by the use of bodily visual resources. Interestingly, not all mocking enactments include a multimodally exaggerated depiction, but instead, some merely allude to an absurd hypothetical scenario. Our findings contribute to the growing body of literature on multimodal stance-taking, by showing how a nuanced interpretation of the Stance Triangle can offer a useful framework for analyzing layered stance acts."

The use of an Electronic Health Record database can avoid biases to give an overview of the extent of health problems in this population. Therefore, the aim of this study is to gain insight into both physical and mental health related issues in classical music students using this type of data collection. An Electronic Health Record database including five years of data from a Performing Arts Health Centre of a university or the arts, was used to analyze the number and characteristics of health consultations in music students. The total number of students, health consultations and the average number of visits per health consultation were calculated over five years. Furthermore, numbers and percentages of both physical and mental health consultations were registered. Also, the number and percentage of health consultations per instrument group were compared to the proportion of each instrument group within the specific sample. Over a period of five years, students visited the PAHC and health consultations were reported. .% of the students who visited a health professional indicated at least one physical health consultation, .% at least one mental health consultation and .% at least one in both categories. An injury was the most frequently registered physical health consultation , followed by performance improvement and stress . Voice students registered relatively most health consultations. As far as we know, this is the first cross-sectional study using Electronic Health Record data from a PAHC to gain insight into both physical and mental health related issues in a population of classical music students. Looking at the variety of health consultations registered in the database, a multidisciplinary team and multidisciplinary approach are necessary to meet the needs of the students in terms of physical and mental health support and performance improvement."

In between there are many mixed modes, such as playback performances. In empirical music research, this plurality of performance forms has so far found little recognition. Until now no measuring instrument has existed that could adequately capture the differences in perception and aesthetic judgment. The purpose of our empirical investigation was to capture all dimensions relevant to such an assessment. Using D-simulations and dynamic binaural synthesis, various live and medial situations were simulated. A qualitative survey was conducted at the Department of Audio Communication of the Technical University of Berlin . With the help of the repertory grid technique, a data pool of approximately attribute pairs was created and individual rating data were collected. Our first study served to create a semantic differential. In a second study, this semantic differential was evaluated. The development of the semantic differential was carried out by first using a mixed-method approach to qualitative analysis according to grounded theory. Thereafter, a principal component analysis reduced the attribute pairs to items in four components. The semantic differential consists of items concerning acoustic, visual and audio-visual interaction as well as items with an overarching assessment of the stimuli. The evaluation study, comprising participants who rated stimuli each, reduced the items to and resulted in subscales and nine single items. Because the survey used simulations, the social component may be underrepresented. Nevertheless, the questionnaire we created enables the evaluation of music performances in a new scope, thus opening many opportunities for further research. For example, in a live concert context, we observed not only that seating position influences the judgment of sound quality but also that visual elements influence immersion and felt affect. In the future, the differential could be reviewed for a larger stimulus pool, extended or used modularly for different research questions."

A typical issue, the burden of child rearing and family responsibilities, was also reported, but it was not the primary reason for their career transitions. Instead, the women workers often mentioned these responsibilities along with other reasons. Other reasons were unresolved career interests and expectations associated with their lack of career goals and preparation prior to joining the labor market. These factors led to significant changes in women’s values and priorities along their career path, which finally triggered a decision to make a career transition. South Korean socio-cultural characteristics embedded in the South Korean women’s personal and organizational lives provide insights on how to interpret the findings.

Additionally, the path analysis of the structural equation model revealed the mechanisms behind the key psychological factors that influenced patient satisfaction.ResultsMedical risk perception, the social cognition of the medical environment, and social desirability bias had significant positive impacts on patient satisfaction. By contrast, negative emotions had a significant negative impact on patient satisfaction. Notably, patients’ negative emotions had both a suppressive effect and a positive moderating effect on the relationship between medical risk perception and patient satisfaction. Similarly, social desirability bias had a suppressive effect on the correlation between the social cognition of the medical environment and patient satisfaction, albeit with a negative moderating effect.DiscussionThese results suggest that when evaluating and improving patient satisfaction, accounting only for the factors that directly influence medical service quality is insufficient, as the indirect and moderating effects of patients’ negative emotions and the social cognition of the medical environment must also be considered. Medical service providers should thus address patients’ negative emotions, establish good doctor–patient relationships, optimize service environments, provide managers with medical risk education and training on negative emotions, and prioritize patient-centered care.

Participants were recruited through a non-probability convenience sampling method from English language courses. They completed validated self-report questionnaires assessing mindfulness, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and psychological well-being. Structural Equation Modeling and mediation analysis were employed to explore the relationships among these constructs.ResultsThe study found that mindfulness and self-efficacy independently and directly predicted psychological well-being among Chinese EFL learners. Additionally, self-regulation emerged as a significant mediator in the relationship between mindfulness and psychological well-being, suggesting that mindfulness enhances well-being indirectly through improved self-regulation skills.DiscussionThese findings underscore the critical roles of mindfulness practices, self-efficacy beliefs, and self-regulation skills in promoting psychological well-being among EFL learners. The implications of this study extend to mindfulness-based interventions and programs designed. However, the study’s cross-sectional design limits causal inference, and the use of self-report measures may introduce biases.

In recent years, with its growing development power, AI technologies have made significant progress and are now being used in many fields. Like in all areas, the use of AI technologies in academia has provided convenience to academics while also bringing ethical debates. In the literature part of the study, concepts such as AI, academia, academics and academic progress, ethics, ethical theories, academic ethics, and emotional states have been thoroughly examined and defined. In this study, starting from AI and scientific ethics, ethical issues arising from emotional states in academic research have been identified, and concrete solutions to these ethical issues have been proposed. The aim is to discuss the views of academics in order to determine what types of scientific ethical violations and prevention methods are involved. In this context, the semi-structured interview technique, which is one of the qualitative research methods, was preferred as the method. In the study, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with ethics experts and psychology experts selected through snowball sampling technique. The data obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews will be analyzed using content analysis. Within the context of the literature review and interviews: Ethics is based on the foundation of acting correctly. In this context, scientific ethics can be summarized as acting truthfully and honestly, not distorting data, and not trying to progress unfairly. The use of AI in academia is becoming increasingly widespread. From a positive perspective, this usage significantly contributes to making studies more practical. However, it can lead to problems such as unfair authorship, devaluation of human authorship, and incorrect data. The connection between academics’ professional advancement goals and emotional states becomes prominent in this context. The potential of AI to facilitate progression can lead to unethical use. To prevent such situations, it is recommended to organize training sessions to increase professional awareness, internalize ethics personally, establish ethical committees specific to the field of AI, conduct more effective audits by academic publication and promotion committees, and implement specific regulations for AI. Finally, for future academic studies, it is suggested that the usage of AI in academic research be measured and evaluated by ethics experts. For psychologists, conducting surveys with academics to explore how they use AI in the context of their emotional states and professional advancement goals is recommended."

A target word in the sequence appeared with a gesture presented in its original position synchronized with speech, temporally shifted ms before or after the original position, or with the gesture eliminated. Participants were asked to retell the videos in a free recall task. The strength of recall was operationalized as the inclusion of the target word in the free recall.ResultsBoth eliminated and delayed gesture strokes resulted in reduced recall rates compared to synchronized strokes, whereas there was no difference between advanced and synchronized strokes.

Conversely, positive soundscapes can have a beneficial impact on health by alleviating stress and fatigue, promoting psychological recovery. To assess the restorative potential of soundscapes, various scales have been developed to create environments conducive to recovery. However, current research on perceptual restorativeness soundscape scales primarily focuses on adults, lacking a dedicated scale for children to evaluate the restorative potential of their surrounding acoustic environments from their perspective.MethodsTherefore, this study introduces the development and validation process of the Perceived Restorativeness of Soundscapes Scale for Children using survey questionnaires and data statistical analysis.ResultsThe study comprises two experiments. Experiment one aims to develop an effective PRSS-C, evaluating the restorative potential of soundscapes in different environments among children aged -. Through a series of analyses, a dual-factor structure scale consisting of items is developed, revealing that the restorative potential of soundscapes is lower in urban centers than in urban suburbs and lower in urban suburbs than in urban peripheral forests. Experiment two aims to further validate the effectiveness of PRSS-C. children aged - assess the restorative potential of soundscapes in similar environments using the PRSS-C developed in experiment one. Factor analysis confirms the dual-factor structure, with assessment results indicating that the restorative potential of soundscapes in Temple of Heaven Park is lower than in the National Botanical Garden. This suggests that PRSS-C enables children to differentiate the restorative potential of soundscapes in similar environments within the same city, further confirming its effectiveness.DiscussionThis study successfully develops and validates the PRSS-C through two experiments. The use of this scale allows for the assessment of the restorative potential of acoustic environments surrounding children, providing an effective tool for evaluating and creating positive soundscapes for children."

This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties, including factor structure, internal consistency, and nomological validity, of the Swedish version of IPP . In a sample of Swedish students , Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted to scrutinize S-IPP’s structure. The analyses supported a bifactor model with six specific factors and one overarching factor. However, two items in the scale displayed poor alignment with their intended subscales, adversely affecting the internal consistency of the two subscales. Consequently, a rephrasing of these items was suggested. The remaining four S-IPP subscales exhibited good internal consistency . Convergent validity was confirmed by largely replicating correlations among various S-IPP facets, the unidimensional IP measure, personality variables, and self-esteem, thereby accomplishing the goal of validating S-IPP. This proposed modification of the two items requires further validation using a new sample to ensure its appropriateness and effectiveness in measuring the intended constructs."

Subjects are divided into two groups and complete a Grammaticality Judgment and Correction Task through a behavioral experiment online. The results from multiple sources show that: both L and L are sources of language transfers and the perceived crosslinguistic similarity of abstract structural properties serves as the main reason; language transfers can be non-facilitative on L learning; as L proficiency level improves, the less likely learners are to be affected by non-facilitative language transfers in L learning, but it may not disappear completely; the background language with higher proficiency level is more likely to impose language transfers in L learning.

Both are key objectives of vocational education and training programs and advantageous for employees and employers. For employees, vocational identification is often associated with positive work-related emotions and job satisfaction; for employers, workers’ identification with the organization and the career enhances their performance and reduces turnover. Thus, investment in employees’ professional development that has the potential to support vocational identification is advantageous for all involved. In light of current demographic changes and a decreasing demand for full-time work, which are leading to a shortage of skilled workers and lower enrolment in apprenticeship programs, it is essential to bind young talents to companies at an early stage and avoid resignations during or after training. Findings from various empirical studies confirm that those who identify with their chosen career and the organization for which they work are more satisfied, think less about quitting, and perform better. Little empirical research has been conducted on how apprentices in VET programs identify with their career or organization or the extent to which such identification enhances their job satisfaction. In this study, we therefore investigate factors that influence apprentices’ identification with their career and organization, in particular, the effects of training quality and trainer competence. Our results indicate that apprentices identify strongly with their career and with the organization where they are doing their training and are mostly satisfied with the quality of their training. Structural equation modeling reveals the relevance of career choice, training quality, and job satisfaction for identification with an organization and with a career. The learning and working conditions in the organization, and more specifically, the variety of tasks offered to the apprentices and the trainer’s pedagogical aptitude explain satisfaction with the training and career identification; the trainer’s presence and the apprentices’ satisfaction with training explain, to some degree, variance in organizational identification."

Despite its importance, there is no unifying definition of the term, nor are there widely accepted measures of consciousness. Indeed, it is likely that consciousness—by its very nature—eludes measurement. It is, however, possible to measure how consciousness manifests as a lived experience. Yet here, too, holistic measures are lacking. This investigation describes the development and validation of the Awareness Atlas, a measure of the manifestation of consciousness. The scale was informed by heart-based contemplative practices and the resulting lived experience with a focus on the impacts of manifestation of consciousness on daily life. Four hundred forty-nine individuals from the USA, Canada, India, and Europe participated in psychometric testing of the scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used for validation, demonstrating excellent validity in measuring manifestation of consciousness. The final model fit exceeded all required thresholds, indicating an excellent fitted model with a single dimensionality to measure the manifestation of consciousness comprised of four subscales: Relationship to Others; Listening to the Heart; Connection with Higher Self; and Acceptance and Letting Go. Number of years meditating and practicing Heartfulness meditation were positively related to the total and subscale scores. Test–retest reliability was excellent for the total scale, and good to excellent for the four subscales. Findings demonstrate that the Awareness Atlas is a well-constructed tool that will be useful in examining changes in manifestation of consciousness with various experiences ."

This approach aims to equip parents and carers to manage behaviors in a person-centered and non-confrontational way. There is a paucity of published research exploring the experiences of families applying this approach.MethodsSeventeen parents who had received training in the Low Arousal Approach were interviewed to gain their perspectives on supporting their family members using this approach.ResultsThematic analysis revealed themes relating to parental stress, which was related to external pressures, isolation, family stress, and challenges in their caring role. They described encountering negative narratives relating to self-criticism and negative judgments from others. Training in the Low Arousal Approach was related to being empowered through access to evidence, increased confidence, and increased ability to advocate for their family member’s needs.

Previous evidence suggests that observing individuals in painful situations elicits whole bodily responses, unveiling the interdependence of the body and empathy. Although the role of the body has been extensively described, the temporal structure of bodily responses and its association with the comprehension of subjective experiences remain unclear.ObjectiveBuilding upon the enactive approach, our study introduces and examines “bodyssence,” a neologism formed from “body” and “essence.” Our primary goal is to analyze the temporal dynamics, physiological, and phenomenological elements in synchrony with the experiences of sportspersons suffering physical accidents.MethodsUsing the empirical E approach, a refinement of Varela’s neurophenomenological program, we integrated both objective third-person measurements and first-person descriptions . Thirty-five participants watched videos of sportspersons experiencing physical accidents during extreme sports practice, as well as neutral videos, while standing on a force platform and wearing electrodermal and heart electrodes. Subsequently, micro-phenomenological interviews were conducted.ResultsBodyssence is composed of three distinct temporal dynamics. Forefeel marks the commencement phase, encapsulating the body’s pre-reflective consciousness as participants anticipate impending physical accidents involving extreme sportspersons, manifested through minimal postural movement and high heart rate. Fullfeel, capturing the zenith of empathetic engagement, is defined by profound negative emotions, and significant bodily and kinesthetic sensations, with this stage notably featuring an increase in postural movement alongside a reduction in heart rate. In the Reliefeel phase, participants report a decrease in emotional intensity, feeling a sense of relief, as their postural control starts to reach a state of equilibrium, and heart rate remaining low. Throughout these phases, the level of electrodermal activity consistently remains high.ConclusionThis study through an enactive approach elucidates the temporal attunement of bodily experience to the pain experienced by others. The integration of both first and third-person perspectives through an empirical E approach reveals the intricate nature of bodyssence, offering an innovative approach to understanding the dynamic nature of empathy."

This cross-sectional study, utilizing a multi-informant design, examined the association between discrepancies in parents’ and adolescents’ reports of expectations, and adolescents’ study engagement, as well as the mediating role of parent–child relational qualities perceived by both parties. The sample for this study consisted of adolescents and their parents from classes in a junior high school in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The adolescents had an average age of . years, and .% of them were boys. Both parents and adolescents reported on their expectations and perceived relational quality, while adolescents also filled out questionnaires assessing their learning engagement. Data were analyzed using polynomial regressions with response surface analysis. The results revealed that when adolescents reported high expectations, regardless of whether their parents reported high or low expectations, adolescents reported satisfied relationships and high learning engagement. In contrast, parents reported satisfied relationships when both parties reported high expectations, or when parents reported higher expectations than adolescents. Lastly, the association between discrepancies in expectations and learning engagement was significantly mediated by adolescent-reported relationships but not parent-reported ones.

As for the context factor in Experiment , some effects were the same for L and L processing: all participants read given NPs faster than new ones and preferred sentences with a ‘given – new’ word order. The latter may reflect the universal principles of narrative coherence. However, unlike native speakers, L readers are not sensitive to more subtle contextual requirements of different word orders."

In the Deese-Roediger-McDermott illusion this phenomenon, called the mirror effect, occurs when participants focus on unique features of each of the words in the study list. In previous studies, the pleasantness rating task, used to foster distinctive encoding, generated different patterns of results. The main aim of our research is to examine under what circumstances this task can produce the mirror effect in the DRM paradigm, based on evidence from recognition accuracy and subjective retrieval experience. In Experiment , a standard version was used for comparison with two other encoding conditions: shallow processing and a read-only control. The standard task, compared to the other conditions, increased correct recognition, but did not reduce false recognition, and this result may be affected by the number of lists presented for study. Therefore, in experiment , to minimize the possible effect of the so-called retention size, the number of studied lists was reduced. In addition, the standard version was compared with a supposedly more item-specific version , also including the read-only control condition. In both versions of the pleasantness rating task, more correct recognition is achieved compared to the control condition, with no differences between the two versions. In the false recognition observed here, only the specific pleasantness rating task achieved a reduction relative to the control condition. On the other hand, the subjective retrieval experience accompanied correct and false recognition in the various study conditions. Although the standard pleasantness rating task has been considered to perform item-specific processing, our results challenge that claim. Furthermore, we propose a possible boundary condition of the standard task for the reduction of false recognition in the DRM paradigm."

Given the acknowledged limited reliability of clinician-based evaluation in the mental health sector, particularly for the assessment of competence to consent, our objective was to ascertain the dependability of clinical judgment when evaluating the ability of schizophrenia patients to make choices about their health.MethodsThe potential convergence between clinical evaluation and scores from a new standardized assessment was therefore tested. The scale assesses four dimensions of competence, specifically how patients normally understand information relating to care ; how they evaluate the choice of treatment in terms of risk/benefit ratio ; how they reason coherently in the decision-making process ; and, finally, their ability to make a choice between treatment alternatives . Thirty-four outpatients with schizophrenia were evaluated for their competence to consent by five referring clinicians with different backgrounds . Inter-raters variability was tested through correlation analyses between the scores obtained by the clinicians on a modified version of the Global Assessment of Functioning scale designed specifically to subjectively assess functioning in each of the four competence dimensions. Two validated competence scales , and a neuropsychological battery were also administered along with scales for evaluating neuropsychiatric symptoms severity and side effects of medication.ResultsClinical judgments of the individual specialists showed great inter-rater variability. Likewise, only weak/non-significant correlations were found between the EICT subscales and the respective clinicians-rated GAF scales. Conversely, solid correlations were found between the EICT and MacCAT-T subscales. As expected, healthy controls performed better in the ability to give informed consent to treatment, as measured by the three scales , and neuropsychological test performance. In the comparisons between patients who, according to the administered EICT, were able or not able to give informed consent to treatment, significant differences emerged for the Phonemic verbal fluency task , Verbal judgments , MacCAT-T subscales, and SICIATRI-R total score. Moreover, EICT exhibited excellent internal consistency while the Item Analysis, by measuring the correlation between each item of the EICT and the total score, was excellent for all items of all subscales .DiscussionIn conclusion, our findings highlighted that the assessment of competence exclusively through clinical judgment is not fully reliable and needs the support of standardized tools. The EICT scale could therefore be useful in assessing general competence to consent both in healthcare and legal contexts, where it might be necessary to evaluate the effective competence of patients with psychiatric disorders. Finally, this scale could serve as a valuable tool for decisions regarding whether and to what extent a patient needs support."

In history, there are two main positions on the relationship between culture and self-construal: the cultural determinist position and the interaction position. After analyzing literature critically, we propose that the interaction position is more persuasive than the cultural determinist position. A self-construal model was constructed from an interactionist and polycultural perspective, pointing out the relationship between three cultures and self-construal. We argue that individuals interacting with cultures in the context of globalization can develop a more integrated self-construal. The present study proposes the existence of polycultural self-construal, and aimed to explore how self-construal factors relate to cultures.MethodsThree approaches—psychological tests, priming with cultural icons and content analysis—were used to explore mechanisms between cultures and self-construal. In Study , we recruited undergraduate students as participants through campus advertising to complete three psychological tests, namely, the Cultural Identity Scale , the Marlowe-Crowne Social Approval Scale , and the Polycultural Self-construal Scale . In Study , we created icon materials that could prime the three cultures. The experimental process was divided into two stages: priming and measurement. First, participants were presented with icon materials on the computer screen to activate the corresponding culture, and then they were asked to complete the PSCS. In Study , the experimental procedures were followed as for Study . Then the Ten Statements Test was used. Each of the participants gave different responses to the question of “Who am I?.” Each participant’s “I am …” narratives were qualitatively processed using content analysis.ResultsThe individual-oriented culture mainly affects the individuality and equality factor of self-construal. The relationship-oriented culture mainly impacts the relationality factor of self-construal, while the social-oriented culture mainly affects the collectivity and equality factors of self-construal. There were no significant differences in the effects of the three cultures on the autonomy factor of self-construal. The multi-components of the polycultural self-construal are difficult to interpret based on one culture type. All three cultures have specific and shared effects on human self-construal."

Such a phenomenon is called anticipatory planning for prior intentions and is known to decline with age. In daily life activities, we often need to consider and plan for multiple demands in one movement sequence. However, previous studies only considered one dimension of prior intentions, either different types of onward actions or different precisions of fit or placement. Therefore, in this study, we investigated anticipatory planning for both extrinsic and intrinsic target-related properties in a computer-based movement task and analyzed the computer cursor movement kinematics of both young and older adults. We found that older people consider and adjust for different properties step-by-step, with movement direction being considered as a prior intention during reach movement and fit precision as a motor constraint during drop movement. The age-related changes in the completion of onward actions are constrained by one’s general cognitive ability, sensorimotor performance and effective motor planning for prior intentions.

As Generation Z employees have gradually entered the labor market, they contribute new perspectives and energies to various enterprises and pose unique challenges. The traditional step-by-step approach no longer meets the needs of today’s businesses. Companies require more proactive talents to drive superior performance. Individuals with proactive behavior can effectively plan their career paths and are better equipped to fulfill core organizational tasks. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to effectively mitigate the perceived negative impacts of proactive behavior, encouraging individuals to exhibit more positive proactive actions.MethodsBased on the proactive motivation model, this study investigates the effects of mentoring, balanced psychological contract, proactive behavior, and agreeableness on the proactive behaviors of new employees. The research surveyed new employees from Guangdong Province, China, who had graduated within the last three years, with a gender distribution of .% male and .% female.ResultsStructural Equation Modeling was used for data analysis, and the following results were obtained: First, mentoring positively affected the balanced psychological contract and new employees’ proactive behavior. Second, mentoring positively affected the new employees’ proactive behavior through the balanced psychological contract. Third, agreeableness played a moderating role in the relationship between mentoring and new employees’ proactive behavior, and in the relationship between mentoring and the balanced psychological contracts. Finally, the positive indirect effect of mentoring through the balanced psychological contract on new employees’ proactive behavior is positively moderated by agreeableness.ConclusionThe results of this study offer new insights into mentoring research for new employees and provide practical guidance for fostering the balanced psychological contract and proactive behavior among new employees. This research enriches the existing literature on mentoring for new employees by demonstrating the integral roles of agreeableness and a balanced psychological contract in fostering proactive behavior, offering valuable insights for organizational practices aimed at enhancing employee proactivity."

Art therapy has a well-established clinical history, and recent research has begun to demonstrate its effectiveness in somatic pediatric wards. Descriptive and statistical research indicates that art therapy can alleviate anxiety and fear, improve mood, and enhance communication among children, parents, and healthcare professionals. This study aims to enhance our understanding of the specific elements of art therapy that facilitate a connection with the healthier aspects of the self.MethodA total of hospitalized children, aged –, participated in an art therapy session led by a certified art therapist. Verbalizations during the sessions were recorded, and subsequent observations were synchronized with verbatim transcriptions of audio recordings. A reflexive thematic analysis was conducted to identify relevant patterns of meaning.FindingsThe study identified four significant dimensions of the children’s experiences during art therapy: The child feels safe, The child becomes a competent artist, bursting with creativity, The healthy child emerges, and The child achieves something beyond its limits – a triumph.DiscussionThe active ingredients contributing to effective art therapy include the stimulation of creativity, guided art-making with scaffolding support, task variation, granting children control over the artistic process, encouragement of free expression, and the display of positive regard. This study also delves into the therapeutic alliance, emphasizing its role in facilitating children’s learning, self-expression, concentration, and the creation of work they take pride in. Additionally, certain psychotherapy-like interactions, such as control-mastery dynamics, were observed.

Positioned as future gatekeepers, pre-service teachers are the key to teaching media skills and especially information literacy to future generations of pupils. Given the particular challenges facing educators today compared to previous generations, it is important to determine whether the next generation of teachers feel adequately prepared and perceive themselves as competent to pass on these skills to their future pupils. However, previous research has highlighted deficiencies in formal learning opportunities at universities, underscoring the need for further investigation into pre-service teachers’ information acquisition, evaluation practices as well as their perceived relevance to teaching, and person-related factors associated with their perceived competence in teaching information literacy.MethodAn online questionnaire was presented to participants, employing a mixed-method approach. We qualitatively examined the sources of information used by pre-service teachers and the evaluation strategies they employ, while quantitatively analyzing relationships between pre-service teachers’ person-related factors and their perceived teaching competence. Participants assessed their perceived teaching competence, perceived learning opportunities, self-efficacy , perceived informedness, selective exposure, need for cognition, need for cognitive closure, and mistrust in media coverage.ResultsData from participants revealed digital media dominance in information acquisition over traditional sources, albeit with a prevalence of surface-level evaluation strategies over reflective approaches. Two distinct dimensions of perceived competence in teaching information literacy emerged: one focusing on information assessment while the other centers on the understanding of news creation processes. Perceived competence in teaching information literacy was significantly associated with self-efficacy in information assessment, perceived informedness, selective exposure to information as well as perceived learning opportunities focusing on information evaluation. Moreover, pre-service teachers employing diverse information evaluation strategies demonstrated a heightened sense of perceived competence in teaching information assessment.DiscussionOur results provide valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of pre-service teachers’ perceived competence in teaching information literacy. Theoretical implications for future research as well as practical implications for teacher education and the structure of future curricula are discussed."

There is a growing commitment in public health to understand and improve the health and well-being of LGTB people, and it is very important that professionals in social, educational and health care settings are adequately trained and informed to solve the problems that persist in this population. The aim of this study was to identify homophobic and lesbophobic attitudes in a Spanish youth population, analyzing the relationship of these attitudes with sociodemographic, cultural, political and personal variables.MethodsA descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out with young people aged – years. The information was collected through the Modern Homophobia Scale of Raja &amp; Stokes, in which sociodemographic and sociocultural variables were also gathered. The data were analyzed and correlations were estimated.ResultsThe males showed a more negative attitude toward homosexual people compared to the females. The participants with a higher education level presented more positive attitudes toward homosexual people. Younger people with a heterosexual orientation had more negative attitudes toward homosexual people compared to those with a homosexual orientation. The participants with a stronger right-wing political tendency presented a greater percentage of negative attitudes toward LGTB people.ConclusionVariables such as education level, sexual orientation and political ideology may have a significant influence on the attitudes toward homosexual men and/or lesbian women.

These challenges stem from witnessing patients’ suffering and managing difficult tasks . Furthermore, these professionals encounter emotional demands, such as emotional effort, which is the dissonance between the emotion felt and the emotion that should be expressed to meet work expectations. Consequently, we aimed to investigate whether different profiles exist concerning nurses’ levels of emotional effort over a five-day period and whether these profiles are related to daily STS and vitality.MethodsThe sample comprised nursing professionals from ICUs in Spanish hospitals. They were assessed daily, using a package of questionnaires twice per day for five working days: a) immediately after their shift and b) at a later time after working.ResultsThe findings revealed three distinct profiles based on emotional effort levels: high , moderate , and low . These profiles were found to be negative predictors for both daily shattered assumptions and symptomatology.DiscussionThis study underscores the importance of assessing daily emotional demands in an ICU setting. Such assessments are crucial for establishing preventive measures to help nursing professionals manage lower-level emotional demands."

No research to date has directly explored the association between parental phubbing and child–parent interaction. Since parental phubbing is a way how parents interact with their children , it might be associated with the way how children interact with their parents , such as filial piety behavior, which prescribes how children behave toward their parents and remains one of the goals of parents in educating their children in modern Chinese society. Based on social exchange theory and social gender theory, this study investigated the impact of parental phubbing on filial piety behavior and tested its mediation of perceived parental rejection, its moderation of gender among children and adolescents.MethodsThis study was conducted using a questionnaire method. A total of students from Grade to was surveyed using the Parental Phubbing Scale, Perceived Parental Rejection Questionnaire, and the revised Dual Filial Piety Scale.ResultsFirst, parental phubbing was negatively correlated with reciprocal filial piety behavior, but not correlated with authoritarian filial piety behavior. Second, perceived parental rejection played a mediating role between parental phubbing and RFP behavior. Third, this direct effect was moderated by gender, in that it was stronger for boys than for girls.ConclusionThese findings suggest that there are intergenerational costs of phubbing, such as reducing children and adolescents’ RFP behavior.

The object of investigation in this paper are therefore questioning sequences in which a coach asks a question immediately after a rephrasing or relocating action, prompting the client to respond in an explicit or implicit way. The coach hereby shifts the focus to a hypothetical scenario, prompting the client to change her perspective on the matter and reflect on her own statements, ideas and attitudes from an outside perspective. The paper aims to contribute to closing the research gap of the change potential of reflection-stimulating action techniques used by coaches, by investigating one of many ways of how questions can be powerful tools to invite a change of perspective for the client. The study focuses on one coaching process consisting of three sessions between a female coach and a female client, utilizing a single case study approach. The data collection was part of the interdisciplinary project “Questioning Sequences in Coaching”, comprising authentic coaching processes. The analysis follows Peräkylä’s Transformative Sequences model, examining the first position including the formulation and the subsequent question, the client’s response, and the coach’s reaction to the response. On a practical level, the main purpose of this paper is not to contribute to the many ways practical literature recommends coaches how to do their work and how to ask questions, but rather to show in what ways the elicitation of self-reflection processes in clients has been achieved by other coaches in authentic coaching sessions."

This study aimed to find out whether the RS-V is also able to predict future violent and aggressive incidents during imprisonment.MethodsThe predictive validity of the RS-V for future violent and aggressive incidents during a follow-up time of months within prison was analyzed, using a file-based design. Violent incidents toward staff and other inmates , other aggressive incidents , and both categories combined, were included as outcome measures based on disciplinary reports.ResultsThe RS-V showed medium to large predictive values for both violent and aggressive behavior during prison stay. In particular, good predictive values of the RS-V were found for violence toward prison staff.DiscussionThis study shows that, besides post-release violent recidivism, the RS-V is able to accurately predict future violent and aggressive incidents during prison stay.

This study investigates the association between alexithymic traits, self-perceived well-being, and self-representations in adolescents as expressed via narrative metaphors during the COVID- epidemic.MethodsThe sample comprised Italian adolescents . The research design was based on an exploratory, parallel, mixed-method approach. A semi-structured online interview was used as the major data gathering tool including both standardized quantitative questionnaire and open-ended questions.

Markedness was manipulated by probing agreement with both first-person and third-person subjects. Agreement was manipulated by crossing first-person marked subjects with third-person unmarked verbs and vice versa. Crucially, person violations with st person subjects yielded significantly shorter RTs in the SPRT and higher accuracy in the GJT than the opposite error type . This effect is consistent with the claim that when the first element in the dependency is marked , the parser generates stronger predictions regarding upcoming agreeing elements.

This was examined in three studies, one with a military sample consisting of men , another with a civilian sample of men , and a third study with a civilian sample of women . Our findings revealed that quality contact was related to attitudes toward women in the military for all three samples. Results from the indirect effects tests conducted for the civilian male and female samples revealed that for civilian men, intergroup anxiety demonstrated a significant indirect effect between quantity contact and attitudes toward women in the military, while both intergroup anxiety and perspective-taking demonstrated significant indirect effects between quality contact and attitudes toward women in the military.

Twenty participants were engaged on a first-come, first-served basis, ensuring adherence to social distancing measures. Feedback was continuously gathered, leading to two post-program focus group sessions. Qualitative data underwent thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's approach, with study quality maintained by the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research . To gauge adaptability, we aligned the program with various learning outcomes frameworks and explored its fit within CBMC using Bourdieu's Theory of Practice.ResultsThe pilot PMR program was well-received and effectively incorporated into our CBMC. Our analysis revealed five central themes tied to PMR's impact: Self-control, Self-realization, Liberation, Awareness, and Interpersonal relationships. Feedback indicated the program's capacity to mitigate stress during the pandemic. The SRQR confirmed the study's alignment with qualitative research standards. Further, the PMR program's contents resonated with principal domains of learning outcomes, and its integration into CBMC was supported by Bourdieu's Theory.

In our study, we delve deeper into the phenomenon of Gestalt recognition in visual cubist art, a transformative process culminating in what is often described as an Aha moment. This Aha moment signifies a sudden understanding of what is seen, merging seemingly disparate elements into a coherent meaningful picture. The onset of this Aha moment can vary, either appearing almost instantaneously, which is in line with theories of hedonic fluency, or manifesting after a period of time, supporting the concept of delayed but more in-depth meaningful insight.MethodsWe employed pupillometry to measure cognitive and affective shifts during art interaction, analyzing both maximum pupil dilation and average dilation across the trial. The study consisted of two parts: in the first, participants identified faces in cubist paintings under various conditions, with Aha moments and pupil dilation measured. In part , the same participants assessed the artworks through ratings in a no-task free-viewing condition.ResultsResults of part indicate a distinctive pattern of pupil dilation, with maximum dilation occurring at both trial onset and end. Longer response times were observed for high-fluent, face-present stimuli, aligning with a delayed but accurate Aha-moment through recognition.

Approximating numerosities without actually counting is an ontogenetically and phylogenetically primordial ability, given its presence in human infants shortly after birth, and in primate and non-primate animal species. Prior research in the field suggested that numerosity approximation is a ballistic automatism that has little to do with human cognition as commonly intended. Here, we measured visual working memory capacity using a state-of-the-art change detection task and numerosity approximation using a dot-comparison task, and found a null correlation between these two parametrical domains. By checking the evidential strength of the tested correlation using both classic and Bayesian analytical approaches, as well as the construct validity for working memory capacity and numerosity approximation estimates, we concluded that the present psychophysical evidence was sufficiently strong to support the view that visual working memory and numerosity approximation are likely to rely on functionally independent stages of processing of the human cognitive architecture."

The project implemented behavioral health training for health service psychology doctoral students with three partner organizations. Trainees received both experiential and didactic training in telehealth and integrated behavioral health. Telehealth was utilized for remote warm hand-offs, hybrid shared appointments, therapy sessions, coordination with providers, and supervision. Program elements included opportunities for consultations with experts in other disciplines, supportive mentorship, exposure to various parts of a healthcare system, and interactions with diverse clients.MethodsThe training program evaluated trainee outcomes using fourteen interviews and three focus groups. Interviews and focus groups examined aspects of the program that contributed to trainees’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes.ResultsEvaluation results revealed increased levels of trainee confidence, autonomy and independence. Training reportedly enabled improved ability to collaborate and communicate with other professions, increased flexibility and adaptability, and openness to others’ ideas. Trainees reported the program’s use of telehealth enhanced awareness of their own skills and team members’ perspectives of technology in care delivery.DiscussionDescriptions of the three care models, lessons learned, and qualitative results about trainee outcomes can be translated into best practices for workforce development and enhance psychology trainees’ self-awareness and ability to incorporate others’ viewpoints about technology and treatment approaches into healthcare."

EF, in turn, underpins lifelong resilience and well-being. Unfortunately, many ECEs report adverse childhood experiences that may compound high stress levels associated with an emotionally and physically demanding profession. ACEs have well-established negative implications for adult well-being and may dampen ECEs’ capacities to engage in emotionally responsive interactions with children. However, many individuals who experience ACEs also report post-traumatic growth experiences that foster empathy, self-determination, and resilience. Such post-traumatic growth may equip teachers with skills to engage in responsive interactions with children that support children’s EF. The aim of this study was to explore the relations of ECE ACEs and post-traumatic growth to the EF of children in their classrooms.MethodsFifty-three female ECEs self-reported on their ACEs and post-traumatic growth. Parents of children rated children’s EF.ResultsIn a set of linear mixed models that accounted for multiple demographic factors and ECE perceived workplace stressors, ECE ACEs were not significantly related to children’s EF scores. However, controlling for ACEs, higher levels of ECE post-traumatic growth were associated with fewer parent-reported EF difficulties in children.DiscussionECEs may draw on the coping skills they have developed in times of adversity to model and promote healthy EF for children. Mental health supports to facilitate ECEs’ processing of their own trauma may be a fruitful means to foster positive early childhood environments that nurture the well-being and resilience of future generations."

In the participants who completed the fantasy measure, low EOT scores predicted stronger SPS positive and negative traits, which predicted a stronger tendency to mentally project oneself into the lives of characters in books, movies, and plays. In Study , the link between EOT and this same fantasizing tendency was again mediated by features of SPS—in this case fantasy proneness and emotional reactivity.DiscussionWe suggest that, whereas individuals who score high on EOT have an impoverished fantasy life, those who score relatively low on EOT and turn their attention inward are able to maintain stronger representations of imagined events in working memory and react more strongly to these events .

In the current study, we explored the unidimensional vs. multidimensional structure of conflict management in family relationships, friendships and romantic relationships across adolescence and adulthood. The sample consisted of Dutch adolescents who were followed over years in measurement waves, and their parents, siblings, best friends , and romantic partner . First-order factor analyses showed that the structure of conflict management is similar for adolescents and adults, across relationships. The results of second-order models, including the theoretical higher dimensions positive/negative conflict management and engagement/disengagement, showed no support for these higher dimensions. The results of bifactor models showed differences between adults and youths: while positive problem solving was part of the general factor of conflict management in adults, it was not part of this general factor in adolescents.

Data processing was performed using Excel® software version and IRaMuTeQ . alpha , allowing organization by category and subsequent thematic analysis using content analysis.ResultsThe textual corpus “Nursing students’ knowledge about sexuality in its diversity,” was divided into two sub-corpus: “Students’ perception of sexuality” and “Students’ perception of gender identity,” originating Class “Eroticism” and Classes “Sexual Orientation” and “Heteronormative” , the latter with greater proximity to each other and consequently to Class . Similarly, Classes “Gender” and “Cisgender” also presented a greater interrelationship between themselves and consecutively with Class “Gender Identity” .DiscussionThe analyses revealed that though nursing students possessed knowledge about sexuality and its diversity, this knowledge was elementary and did not reveal a sustained appropriation of concepts related to sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender diversity. For some questions, the absence of students’ answers were noteworthy, and may be associated with their personal reservation in expressing themselves on this sensitive and intimate theme.

Grounded in the conservation of resources theory , this study explores the crossover effect of managers’ emotional exhaustion on team readiness to change. We expect this to occur through higher levels of laissez-faire leadership, which impacts the teams’ psychological safety.MethodologyData was gathered within a Canadian governmental organization undergoing two significant changes—cultural change and digitalization—with a specific focus on leadership as a pivotal factor in preparing teams for change. Employing surveys from team members and managers affected by this change, we conducted path analysis to empirically test the proposed model across teams and their respective managers.ResultsManagers’ emotional exhaustion has a negative indirect effect on team readiness to change. The double mediation pathway implies a positive relationship on laissez-faire leadership, which hinders psychological safety. In turn, psychological safety hampers team readiness to change.ConclusionManagers must invest significant resources to fulfill their roles and responsibilities during strategic change. Those who feel exhausted during change may look for ways to protect some of their resources by reducing the time and energy they invest leading their team. This self-preserving resource strategy has detrimental consequences on teams’ effectiveness during change due to an indirect crossover effect that affects the levels of psychological safety on the team."

This study investigates the language-specific use of filler particles by bilingual heritage speakers in both their languages, looking at the dominant majority language in the society and their minority heritage language spoken at home. This is done based on heritage Russian and German data and majority German and English data from the RUEG corpus. Language-specific fillers were extracted from the corpus and analyzed for their occurrence and segmental form. The frequency analysis suggests an influence of bilingualism, age group, and formality of the situation on the filler frequency across all languages. The number of filler particles is higher in formal, older, and bilingual speech. The form analysis reveals an effect of language and gender on the type of filler particle. The vocalic-nasal filler particles are more frequently found in German and English and in female speech of these languages. Heritage speakers of Russian in contact with German and English show higher use of vocalic-nasal forms also in their Russian while producing similar gender related patterns to monolingual speakers in both their languages. The higher frequency of filler particles in formal situations, older speakers and in bilingual speech, is discussed related to cognitive load which is assumed to be higher in these contexts while speech style which differs between situations and social groups is also considered as explanation. The higher use of vocalic-nasal filler particles in German and English suggests language specific filler particle preferences also related to the socio-linguistic variable gender in these languages.

This study aimed to examine the home literacy environment and literacy-related skills in -to -year-old Korean–English bilingual children living in an English-speaking country, Australia, whose heritage language is Korean, and to investigate the relationships among the home literacy environment factors and the child-internal literacy-related skills. The study employed parental questionnaires and video analyses of parent–child shared book reading sessions to assess the Korean and English home literacy environment. Children’s early literacy skills in Korean and English, along with their Korean, English, and conceptual vocabulary skills, were measured as literacy-related skills. The findings indicated that parents utilized an indirect approach for Korean literacy practices, in contrast to a more direct and explicit method for English literacy practices.

This is also true for values and civic participation. Therefore, our objective is to identify the directional association between civic participation and Schwartz values, and between values and wellbeing, among older Europeans.MethodsA pseudo-panel was created from the cross-sectional data of the European Social Survey , controlling for gender, age-group, country and level of studies . The data analysis was performed using a cross-lagged model, applying both random-effects and fixed-effects models.ResultsOn the one hand, the relationship between participation and values is bidirectional, but the effect of civic participation on values is more significant since participating stimulates the development of certain values. On the other hand, although the relationship between values and wellbeing is also bidirectional, the effect of wellbeing on values is stronger since a given level of wellbeing favors the development of particular values.DiscussionWe conclude that civic participation should be promoted within the older population since it directly increases wellbeing, and moreover reinforces those values that positively influence the health, happiness and life satisfaction of older people."

Increasingly, because both mothers and fathers can play central caregiving roles, the parenting qualities of both parents demand consideration. Therefore, this study investigated whether parental gender and caregiving role were associated with mothers’ and fathers’ positive affect and negative affect during interactions with their -month-old firstborn infant, while determining whether parenting stress, infant temperament, having a singleton/twin, and living in the Netherlands, France, or the United Kingdom were related to parental positive affect and negative affect. In all, different-sex, same-sex male, and same-sex female couples who conceived through artificial reproductive techniques were studied. The couples were videorecorded at home while in feeding, cleaning, and playing contexts to assess the levels of positive and negative parental affect. In addition, the couples completed questionnaires about their caregiving role, parenting stress, and the infants’ temperament. Mixed linear models indicated that the levels of positive and negative parental affect toward the infant in all contexts were not related to parental gender, caregiving role, the interaction between parental gender and caregiving role, parenting stress, infant temperament, or singleton/twin status. However, the target parental behaviors were related to the country of origin, suggesting differences among Dutch, French, and British parents. Overall, we found no evidence that gender or caregiving roles were associated with the levels of positive and negative affect shown by the parents."

Second, deviations from the mean, whether negative or positive, were deemed less socially appropriate. Third, while there was a strong relationship between variance, social norms, and cooperative behavior, the mediating effect of social norms was found to be insignificant. Finally, there were some notable findings regarding behavior type. Although free riders and cooperators exhibited distinct behavioral patterns, their normative expectations were similar. Free riders expected others to cooperate, but their empirical expectations were significantly lower than cooperators’ expectations, which were aligned with their actual contributions.

In fact, reviews contain rich and multi-dimensional discrete emotional information, and whether there is a relationship between the expression of these different discrete emotions and the time interval between product purchase and review posting as well as their related characteristics are the issues that this study needs to analyze and solve in depth.MethodsBased on the OCC model of psychological emotional cognitive evaluation theory as the basis for emotion classification, the study used the massive amounts of Chinese reviews of mobile phones on the Chinese e-commerce platform Jingdong Mall as the research object, applied supervised machine learning methods to classify discrete emotions, and constructed a large corpus containing satisfaction, disappointment, admiration, reproach, love, and hate; then the study delved into the distribution and behavioral dynamics characteristics of consumers’ comments containing the different discrete emotions at different “purchase-comment” time intervals.ResultsThe results showed that the first peak of the distribution curves of the six discrete emotions at different “purchase-comment” time intervals occurs on the first day after purchase and then decreases gradually but at different rates. The three curves for satisfaction, love, and hate emotions also show a second peak on the eleventh day, which is more similar to the bimodal distribution, implying that the corresponding product reviews are more objective. In addition, the distribution of reviews containing the six discrete emotions at different “purchase-comment” time intervals follows a power-law distribution and has the temporal characteristics of human behavioral dynamics, that is, “strong paroxysms and weak memory“. However, the reviews containing the admiration and reproach emotions were most intensively written by consumers after the purchase, indicating that the service provided by the seller, logistics, and e-commerce platform stimulates more consumers to give quick responses and detailed reviews.ConclusionThis study is not only of great significance for exploring the internal mechanisms of consumer discrete emotional expression but also provides important decision-making references for potential consumer purchasing decisions, product updates for developers, marketing strategy formulation for marketing teams, and service improvement for sellers, logistics companies, and e-commerce platforms."

However, individuals have more conflicting attitudes toward chatbots providing emotional support compared to informational support . This difference may be related to whether individuals associate a certain type of support with the realm of the human mind and whether they attribute human-like minds to chatbots. In the present study, we investigated whether perceiving human-like minds in chatbots affects users’ acceptance of various support provided by the chatbot. In the experiment, the chatbot posed questions about participants’ interpersonal stress events, prompting them to write down their stressful experiences. Depending on the experimental condition, the chatbot provided two kinds of social support: informational support or emotional support. Our results showed that when participants explicitly perceived a human-like mind in the chatbot, they considered the support to be more helpful in resolving stressful events. The relationship between implicit mind perception and perceived message effectiveness differed depending on the type of support. More specifically, if participants did not implicitly attribute a human-like mind to the chatbot, emotional support undermined the effectiveness of the message, whereas informational support did not. The present findings suggest that users’ mind perception is essential for understanding the user experience of chatbot social support. Our findings imply that informational support can be trusted when building social support chatbots. In contrast, the effectiveness of emotional support depends on the users implicitly giving the chatbot a human-like mind."

Adjustment to dynamic environments depends on both aspects of control and the deficits for children with DCD may constrain their ability to perform daily actions that involve dual-tasking. Under the assumption that motor-cognitive integration is compromised in children with DCD, we examined proportional dual-task costs using a novel locomotor-cognitive dual-task paradigm that enlisted augmented reality. We expect proportional dual-task performance costs to be greater for children with DCD compared to their TD peers.MethodsParticipants were children aged – years who walked along a straight m path under single- and dual-task conditions, the cognitive task being visual discrimination under simple or complex stimulus conditions presented via augmented reality. Dual-task performance was measured in two ways: first, proportional dual-task costs were computed for cognitive and gait outcomes and, second, within-trial costs were measured as the difference on gait outcomes between pre- and post-stimulus presentation.ResultsOn measures of pDTC, TD children increased their double-limb support time when walking in response to a dual-task, while the children with DCD increased their locomotor velocity. On p-WTC, both groups increased their gait variability when walking in response to a dual-task, of which the TD group had a larger proportional change than the DCD group. Greater pDTCs on motor rather than cognitive outcomes were consistent across groups and method of dual-task performance measurement.DiscussionContrary to predictions, our results failed to support dramatic differences in locomotor-cognitive dual-task performance between children with DCD and TD, with both groups tending to priorities the cognitive over the motor task. Inclusion of a within-trial calculation of dual-task interference revealed an expectancy effect for both groups in relation to an impending visual stimulus. It is recommended that dual-task paradigms in the future continue to use augmented reality to present the cognitive task and consider motor tasks of sufficient complexity to probe the limits of performance in children with DCD."

Although it is commonly assumed that the ANS directly processes perceptual input and is relatively independent from affective factors, some evidence points at a correlation between ANS performance and math anxiety. However, the evidence is mixed. We tested whether giving participants active control in completing a numerical task would change the relationship between math anxiety on performance.MethodsAdult participants completed a novel four-alternative-forced-choice non-symbolic numerical comparison task. In a repeated-measures design, participants either passively viewed different dot arrays or actively chose to view each array before deciding on the largest quantity. Participants also provided confidence judgments during the passive version of the task.ResultsWe replicated the ratio-dependent signature in participants’ accuracy in both the passive and active versions of the task using this novel paradigm, as well as in trial-level confidence judgments and information-seeking behavior. Participants’ self-reported math anxiety significantly correlated with their accuracy on the passive version of the task. Critically, the correlation disappeared in the active version of the task. Gender also emerged as a predictor of confidence judgments and a moderator of the effect of task on overall accuracy and the effect of active information seeking on accuracy in the active version of the task. Exploratory analysis of estimated Weber Fraction suggests that these results may be driven by auxiliary factors instead of changes in ANS acuity.ConclusionThese findings have implications for understanding the relationship between math anxiety and performance on numerical tasks."

Next, by manipulating participants’ objectification experience, we found the negative effect of objectification on prosocial intention, as well as the mediating role of self-dehumanization . Additionally, we tested the mediating role of self-dehumanization in comparison with relative deprivation , and consistently found that self-dehumanization was a stronger mediator in accounting for the effect of objectification on prosocial intention . Together, our findings support the process of self-dehumanization following objectification and offer new insights into the relationship between objectification and prosociality. The implications and limitations of the research were discussed."

The aim of this study was to establish a typology of men convicted in Spain for a gender violences crimes.MethodologyA total of men participated and were subdivided into three classes of abusers based on their childhood, family experiences with violence, criminal history, sexist attitudes and attitudes toward violence, intensity and type of violence, psychopathological state and attachment style.ResultsCoinciding with the results found in other research, % of the participants were classified as generally violent. They engaged in severe forms of physical, psychological and sexual violence and were more likely to do so than the rest. Additionally, they are more likely to present psychopathological problems and an antisocial character. Twenty-one percent were classified as dysphoric/borderline. They are characterized by minor forms of psychological violence, borderline or depressive symptomatology and an anxious attachment style.

Thus, research investigations tend to limit their scope to solely focusing on the sensation of relaxation that ASMR induces. This study explores whether it is possible to have a different emotional experience and still perceive ASMR, testing the theory of ASMR as an amplifier of pre-existing emotion instead of a determination of positive affect.MethodsThe emotional arousal and valence, and mood changes of ASMR-capable and incapable individuals were analysed using questionnaires after altering the affective interpretation associated with auditory ASMR with visual priming to examine whether the primed emotion could be amplified.ResultsIt was found that an ASMR response occurred in all priming conditions, including the fear priming group. No significant difference was found in the emotional outcome or mood of the neutral and relaxing priming groups. Upon comparison with ASMR-incapable individuals, both the relaxing and neutral priming groups demonstrated the same affect, but greater potent for ASMR-capable. Individuals who appraised ASMR after visual fear priming demonstrated a significant decrease in positive emotional valence and increased arousal.ConclusionThe findings suggest that ASMR occurs in both positive and negative emotional situations, suppressing contentment induction if ASMR stimuli are interpreted negatively and amplifying contentment when interpreted positively. While more research is needed, the results highlight that ASMR and frisson might describe the same phenomenon, both a physically felt signature of emotion. Therapeutic usage of ASMR should carefully select appropriate stimuli that emphasise contentment to avoid potential health risks associated with negative emotions until a further understanding of ASMR’s affective parameters has been established."

Feminist theory suggests that patriarchal ideologies produce an entitlement in male perpetrators of DV; however, this has not been examined in the context of women from the Indian subcontinent. This study examined Indian women’s experiences of abuse and controlling behavior across countries by examining the relationship between the patriarchal beliefs held by the women’s partners and the women’s experience of DV. This study uses an intersectional feminist framework to examine the variables. Data from an online questionnaire was collected from Indian women aged between and years living in countries across Asia , Europe , Oceania , the Americas and Africa and analyzed using a hierarchical linear regression. A majority of participants had experienced at least one form of abuse during their relationship, and over a third had experienced controlling behavior. In support of the central hypotheses, after controlling for potential confounders, women whose partners showed greater endorsement of patriarchal beliefs were less likely to have access to freedom during their relationship and were more likely to have been abused by their partner or a member of his family . The findings of this study highlight the need to engage with men in Indian communities through culturally-tailored intervention strategies designed to challenge the patriarchal ideologies that propagate, justify, and excuse DV."

Here, we examine the relationship between CCA and climate change-related fear in response to messages differently framing uncertainty and anticipation concerning climate change, exploring how the former differs from general anxiety measures. To this purpose, young and healthy volunteers were assigned to three different framing conditions. Their emotional responses as well as eco-emotions and beliefs about climate change were collected. By employing a Bayesian approach, we found that framing the consequences of climate change effectively induces heightened fear and that CCA strongly predicted fear levels, while general anxiety measures did not. Overall, these results reflect CCA’s unique and specific nature in influencing climate change-related fear. Interestingly, we found fear to predict intention scores only following the framings that did not effectively induce action intentions, consistent with prior findings on fear without efficacy framing. Instead, reading about the negative consequences motivated action the most. Following this framing, we found that eco-anger, instead of fear, consistently predicted intentions to engage in climate action.

The nature of the units of cultural evolution in music—memes or, more specifically, musemes—can potentially shed light on the evolutionary processes and pressures attendant upon early-hominin musicality. That is, primarily conjunct, narrow-tessitura musemes and primarily disjunct, wide-tessitura musemes appear to be the outcome of distinct cultural-evolutionary processes. Moreover, musemes in each category arguably acquire their fecundity by appealing to different music-underpinning brain and body subsystems. Given music's status as an embodied phenomenon, both singing-style and brilliant-style musemes recruit and evoke image schemata, but those in the former category draw primarily upon vocal images of line, direction and continuity; whereas those in the latter category draw primarily upon rhythmic impetus and energy. These two museme-categories may have been molded by distinct biological-evolutionary processes—the evolution of fine vocal control, and that of rhythmic synchronisation, respectively; and they might—via the process of memetic drive—have themselves acted as separate and distinct selection pressures on biological evolution, in order to optimize the environment for their replication. As a case-study of singing-style musemes, this article argues that a passage from the love duet “Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix” from Camille Saint-Saëns' opera Samson et Dalila op. is the cultural-evolutionary antecedent of the Introduction/Chorus/Outro material of ABBA's song “The Winner Takes It All.” Discussion of their melodic and harmonic similarities supports a memetic link between elements of Saint-Saëns' duet and ABBA's song. These relationships of cultural transmission are argued to have been impelled by the fecundity of the shared musemes, which arises from the image-schematic and embodied effects of the implication-realisation structures that comprise them; and which is underwritten by the coevolution of musemes with vocal- and rhythmic-production mechanisms, and associated perceptual-cognitive schemata."

The secondary goal was to examine the long-term effects across the same measures, in addition to the overall quality of life.ResultsThe results highlight the benefits of our approach, while participants reported short-term significant pain reduction, decreased anxiety, and increased relaxation. Additionally, preliminary trends suggest improvements in physical activity and quality of life metrics.DiscussionThese positive outcomes highlight HYlaDO’s potential as an alternative to opioid therapy for chronic pain. Encouraged by these results, we aim to extend our research to a broader and more diverse cohort, paving the way for comprehensive randomized controlled trials. This expansion will further validate HYlaDO’s efficacy and its role in transforming chronic pain management."

The spelling errors were made by schoolchildren with and without dyslexia. The high number of inaccuracies observed in the writing of the Group with dyslexia was often related to the complexity of syllabic structures and orthographic irregularity. The syllabic structures, in addition to the consonant-vowel pattern, often pose challenges for all students as they move through the alphabetic writing phase, early in literacy. This classification provides an understanding of the characteristics of Natural Spelling and Arbitrary Spelling, providing support for the teaching-learning of words by dyslexic students and is also relevant for the design of Portuguese language teacher training policies. In the teaching of the orthographic norm, the success and error when writing words should be followed by a reflection and monitoring of learning, both on the part of the teacher and on the part of the learner, reinforcing the knowledge of spelling patterns that will be triggered as the student is exposed to the explicit formal teaching of spelling."

The mediating role of perceived discrimination was investigated using structural equation modeling analysis.ResultsThe study found significant associations between demographic and lifestyle factors and mental health symptoms. Non-Hispanic Blacks or African Americans and Hispanics were less likely than Non-Hispanic Whites to have mental health symptoms. Individuals between the ages of and , to , to , and and older had lower odds of mental health symptoms. Gender differences revealed that females had a higher risk of mental health issues than males. Socioeconomic factors, such as household income and employment status, played a significant role, with higher household income and employment status being associated with a decreased likelihood of mental health symptoms. The study emphasizes the role of perceived discrimination as a mediator, suggesting that it fully mediated the association between cultural identity and mental health symptoms. These findings highlight the significance of addressing discrimination experiences in fostering the mental health of adults from diverse backgrounds.ConclusionThe findings highlight the need to take racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities, as well as cultural identity and prejudice, into account in mental health research and interventions. The identified risk and protective factors can guide interventions and policies to enhance this population’s mental health."

While there are numerous measurement tools to evaluate these abilities, many of them have been designed for specific age groups hampering comparability throughout development. Thus, we determined test–retest-reliability and minimal detectable change for a set of tests that evaluate spatial ability performance in their variety in youth and compared them to young adults.MethodsChildren , adolescents , and young adults performed a set of five spatial ability tests twice, min apart: Paper Folding Test , Mental Rotation Test , Water Level Task , Corsi Block Test , and Numbered Cones Run . Relative and absolute test–retest reliability was determined by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient and the standard error of measurement , respectively. Further, the minimal detectable change was calculated to identify clinically relevant changes between repeated measurements.ResultsIrrespective of test, reliability was “excellent” in all age cohorts and the SEM values were rather small. The MDC% values needed to identify relevant changes in repeated measurements of spatial ability performance ranged between . and .% in children, . and .% in adolescents, and . and .% in young adults.ConclusionThe determined values indicate that the investigated set of tests is reliable to detect spatial ability performance in healthy children, adolescents, and young adults."

It remains unknown whether the different functions of echo questions can be conveyed via prosody in spoken Chinese. Additionally, no comparison was made on the diversified algorithmic models in predicting functions by the prosodity of Chinese echo questions, a novel linguistic cognition in nature. This motivated us to use different acoustic cues to predict different pragmatic functions of Chinese echo questions by virtue of acoustic experiment and data modeling. The results showed that for yes-no echo question, explicatory function exhibited higher pitch and intensity patterns than recapitulatory function whereas for wh-echo question, recapitulatory function demonstrated higher pitch and intensity patterns than explicatory function. With regard to data modeling, the algorithm Support Vector Machine relative to Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed better when predicting different functions using prosodic cues in both yes-no and wh-echo questions.

The present study aimed at investigating social cognition profiles in the two disorders. We included CPP, CSP patients, and healthy controls . Social cognition was assessed with the Ekman- faces test and the Story-Based Empathy Task , whereas global cognitive functioning was measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment . Pain and mood symptoms, coping strategies, and alexithymia were also evaluated. Correlations among clinical pain-related measures, cognitive performance, and psychopathological features were investigated. Results suggested that CSP patients were impaired compared to CPP and HC in social cognition abilities, while CPP and HC performance was not statistically different. Pain intensity and illness duration did not correlate with cognitive performance or psychopathological measures. These findings confirmed the presence of social cognition deficits in chronic pain patients, suggesting for the first time that such impairment mainly affects CSP patients, but not CPP. We also highlighted the importance of measuring global cognitive functioning when targeting chronic pain disorders. Future research should further investigate the cognitive and psychopathological profile of CPP and CSP patients to clarify whether present findings can be generalized as disorder characteristics."

These children face a greater risk of family dysfunction, which can lead to internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. While numerous studies have established a connection between family functioning and problem behaviors, few have explored the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship. Our study seeks to address this gap by examining how emotion regulation and psychological resilience mediate the link between family functioning and problem behavior.MethodsThe sample consisted of preschool children with a mean age of . ± .. The main guardians of the children were given the Family Assessment Device, Preschool Children’s Emotion Regulation Scale, the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment for Preschoolers , and the Social Skills Improvement System-Rating Scales to assess their family functioning, emotion regulation, psychological resilience, and problem behavior respectively.ResultsLower family functioning was associated with more severe problem behaviors in preschool left-behind children, and emotion regulation and psychological resilience partially mediated the relationship between family functioning and problem behaviors, respectively. In addition, emotion regulation and psychological resilience were also chain mediators between family functioning and problem behaviors.ConclusionThe study’s findings highlighted the crucial role of emotional regulation and psychological resilience in the correlation between family functioning and problem behaviors. It is recommended that policymakers and educators place a high priority on the cultivation of internal psychological resources, such as emotional regulation and resilience, in preschool-aged children when designing interventions to address problem behaviors."

However, MA likely has its origins before children go to school. For example, studies have shown that general anxiety for everyday events is less separable from MA in primary than in early secondary school. This suggests that GA may be a precursor of MA. For this reason, here, we have examined whether GA is already associated with math achievement at the end of kindergarten.MethodsWe tested Hungarian kindergarten children aged . to . years and analyzed the effect of GA, sex, and family SES on math achievement in kindergarten children.ResultsStrikingly, confirming results from primary school children, we found that GA negatively correlated with math achievement already in this preschool population. Higher GA levels had a stronger negative effect on girls’ than boys’ math achievement. However, there were no significant sex differences in math achievement in kindergarten. Additionally, family socioeconomic status was the strongest predictor of math achievement.DiscussionWe speculate that high GA in preschool is a plausible early precursor of later high MA.

Like many other invasive procedures, Rf-Tc can generate anxiety in a lot of patients, either during the expectation of the procedure or in the course of it. Virtual reality hypnosis is a promising tool for managing anxiety and pain in several situations, but its anxiolytic property has not been investigated in participants with chronic pain and going through a Rf-Tc procedure.ObjectivesThe goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of VRH for reducing self-assessed anxiety in participants with chronic pain, when received in preparation for Rf-Tc.Materials and methodsThis prospective, controlled trial was conducted in the Interdisciplinary Algology Centre of the University Hospital of Liège . Participants were assigned to two groups: VRH or control . Assessment was carried-out at time points: T ; T ; T ; and T . Medical, sociodemographic data, anxiety trait and immersive tendencies were collected at T. Anxiety state and pain intensity were assessed at each time points. Satisfaction was examined at T.ResultsForty-two participants were quasi-randomly assigned to the VRH or control group. No statistically significant interaction group by time was observed regarding all measured variables, including primary endpoint. However, a significant effect of time was found for anxiety and pain when considering both groups together, toward a progressive reduction.ConclusionIn the context of our study, there appears to be no significant effect of VRH at reducing anxiety in participants with chronic pain undergoing Rf-Tc. Anxiety decreases along the procedure, while pain is attenuated by the local anesthetic infiltration of the Rf site. Our results suggest that the presence of a caregiver throughout the procedure might explain the progressive decrease in anxiety. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to precisely study the effectiveness of the VRH tool, and the possibility of using it as a complementary approach for anxiety during invasive procedures."

Here, we investigated how the writer’s attitude toward his/her past, present and future and the focus of the writing, i.e., social experience in the past versus self-experience, modulate these effects. In Experiment , undergraduates wrote a compassionate letter to their past-self and to their future-self and responded to the Japanese version of the Adolescent Time Inventory–Time Attitudes questionnaire. Writing to past-self decreased negative feelings more than writing to future-self. Further, participants who had negative feelings toward their past, present, and future, as assessed by the ATI-TA, were more likely to be emotionally affected by writing a letter to their past-self. In Experiment , undergraduates wrote a letter focusing on what they had experienced together with someone, and another undergraduates wrote focusing on what they had experienced alone. Focusing on a social experience was more helpful for recovering from negative feelings than focusing on a self-experience. In conclusion, writing a compassionate letter to one’s past-self can improve mood, especially in individuals with a negative time attitude who focus their writing on a social connection."

Virtual reality apps have been shown to distract users from stressors in the environment, but little is known about the efficacy of specific content features to reduce stress or improve mood for consumer users during a pandemic. The present study investigated secondary archival data to explore how mood and usage behavior changed before and after the onset of COVID- for consumer users of a VR app with dynamic, interactive content. Study findings indicate that the COVID- pandemic had significant effects on user behavior and mood. Users created more accounts and used app content more often during the pandemic, while reporting increased negative mood states. This suggests that users were motivated to use the content to cope with pandemic stressors. Users also experienced a greater positive mood change after using the content during the pandemic than before, which implies that elements related to the VR app content met users’ psychological needs. Passive content with less interactivity resulted in a greater positive mood state after the COVID- onset, likely related to its capacity to reduce stress, facilitate restoration, and improve persistent affective states in stressful environments. This study offers a vital window into how consumer users respond to psychosocial pandemic stressors outside of a controlled environment as well as the prospective for VR app content to serve as a valuable mental health intervention during similar stressful events."

However, the rise of “fluid participation”—a constant shift in team composition and skill sets—poses new challenges to traditional coordination mechanisms. In particular, with fluid participation, a team’s roles can oscillate between disconnected and intersecting, or between lacking and having overlap in the capabilities and expectations of different roles. This study investigates the possibility that a disconnected set of roles creates a structural constraint on the flexible coordination needed to perform in volatile contexts, as well as the mitigating role of cognitive versatility in a team’s strategically-central member. Utilizing a sample of teams from a hospital Emergency Department, we find that teams with a disconnected role set are less effective than teams with an intersecting role set as demonstrated by longer patient stays and increased handoffs during shift changes. Importantly, the presence of a cognitively versatile attending physician mitigates these negative outcomes, enhancing overall team effectiveness. Our findings remain robust even after accounting for other variables like team expertise and familiarity. This research extends the Carnegie School’s seminal work on fluid participation by integrating insights from psychology and organizational behavior, thereby identifying key individual attributes that can bolster team coordination in dynamic settings."

The models used acoustic and linguistic features extracted from the speech signal and the transcriptions generated by a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition system.ResultsThe results showed that event-based segmentation led to better ARS performance than interval-based segmentation, as measured by the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic. The results suggest differences in the quality and quantity of the data because of segmentation method. The inclusion of linguistic features improved the detection of whole-word repetitions, but not other types of stutters.DiscussionThe findings suggest that event-based segmentation is more suitable for ARS than interval-based segmentation, as it preserves the exact boundaries and types of stutters.

Parents completed questionnaires detailing aspects of attention and executive function. We used a principal components analysis to derive three domains of neuropsychological functioning: ) task-based executive function skills, ) self-and emotion-regulation abilities, and ) inhibitory control. Additionally, parents completed a home radon test kit and provided information on how long their child had lived in the tested home. We computed a radon exposure index per person based on the duration of time that the child had lived in the home and their measured home radon concentration. Youths were divided into terciles based on their radon exposure index score. Using a MANCOVA design, we determined whether there were differences in neuropsychological domain scores across the three groups, controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic status.ResultsThere was a significant multivariate effect of radon group on neuropsychological dysfunction . Examination of univariate effects revealed specific increases in self-and emotion-regulation dysfunction among the youths with the greatest degree of chronic home radon exposure . There were no significant differences by group in the other tested domains.DiscussionThe data suggest potential specificity in the neurotoxic effects of everyday home radon exposure in developing youths, with significant aberrations in self-and emotion-regulation faculties. These findings support the need for better public awareness and public health policy surrounding home radon safety and mitigation strategies."

It is typically studied in cued task-switching paradigms where there is no uncertainty about the task set or rule to prepare for on each trial. While inhibition has been shown to influence the speed and the accuracy of task execution, affecting task set retrieval, preparation, or implementation in conditions of task set switching, it remains uninvestigated whether it also affects rule selection under uncertainty.MethodsWe implemented an ad-hoc four-rule card sorting task and categorized the rules selected by participants after a rule shift according to the recency of their last usage. We included a measure of working memory capacity to control for its involvement in the rule selection process.ResultsParticipants exhibited a reduced preference for recently abandoned rules than less recently abandoned ones. Furthermore, we found that such a preference was not associated with WMC.DiscussionThe results suggest that decision-making processes underlying rule inference and selection may be influenced by task-set inhibition, configuring as a conflict adjustment mechanism to the sequential history of rules application."

However, no differential therapeutic approach currently exists that is sensitive to the varieties of depression afflicting young people. In fact, the discussion is missing something much more fundamental: a specification of the types of adolescent depression. Recent research that has aimed to classify different kinds of depression has mainly studied adult populations and predominantly used technically complicated measurements of biological markers. The neglect of the potential particularities of dysphoric disorders affecting youths is unfortunate, and the exclusive focus on biological parameters unnecessarily restrictive. Moreover, this one-sidedness obfuscates more directly available sources of clinically relevant data that could orient conceptualization efforts in child and adolescent psychiatry. Particularly, clues for discriminating different types of adolescent depression may be obtained by analyzing personally articulated accounts of how affected young people experience changes in their relation to the world and to themselves. Thus, here we present and discuss the findings of a study that explored the possibility of specifying types of adolescent depression in a phenomenological way. The study investigated the association between these types and the vicissitudes of personality development. In accounts given by youths diagnosed with depression during semi-structured interviews, we identified themes and examined their phenomenological centrality. Specifically, our qualitative analyses aimed to determine the relative importance of certain themes with respect to the overall intelligibility of the described changes to the relational space. Based on the findings of these analyses, we differentiate three specifiers of adolescent depression and suggest an association between particular types of experiences and the trajectory of affected adolescents’ personality development. To our knowledge, this is the first phenomenologically grounded specification of types of adolescent depression with potential therapeutic significance. Thus, based on this contribution, we propose that modes of scientific exploration that are close to phenomenological philosophy—which have been ignored in the context of developmental psychopathology—could offer a foundation to theories developed in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry."

This tension leads to divergent predictions about the use of potentially sensitive language: power might license it, while exposure might inhibit it. Analysis of peoples' language use in a large corpus of organizational emails using standardized Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count measures shows a systematic difference in the use of words with potentially sensitive connotations. People in positions of relative power are ~ times less likely to use sensitive words than people more junior to them. The tendency to avoid potentially sensitive language appears to be independent of whether other people are using sensitive language in the same email exchanges, and also independent of whether these words are used in a sensitive context. These results challenge a stereotype about language use and the exercise of power. They suggest that, in at least some circumstances, the exposure and accountability associated with organizational responsibilities are a more significant influence on how people communicate than social power."

Green transformational leaders exhibit a formidable commitment to sustainability in making managerial choices and subsequently inspiring and motivating their employees to participate vigorously in the ensuing green initiatives. Such initiatives could profoundly help organizations adjust to shifting market situations, follow requirements, and preserve stakeholder trust. While making appeals to the central tenants of the transformation leadership theory, social exchange theory, and the social cognition theory, the study examines the impact of green transformational leadership on employees’ green behaviors during times of crises using employees’ self-esteem as a mediator and work engagement as the critical moderator. The relevant context of the study has been the small and medium enterprises of Saudi Arabia. Data from SMEs employing less than employees selected through convenience sampling was collected using structured questionnaires. After performing hierarchical regression modeling using SPSS , macro V model , and Amos , it has been found that green transformational leadership is positively associated with employees’ green behaviors, with self-esteem and work engagement acting as significant mediating and moderating conditions, respectively.

In this proof-of-concept study, pupil dilation in response to unexpected positive emotional information was examined as a psychophysiological marker of an attenuated processing of positive prediction errors associated with depressive symptoms.MethodsParticipants completed a modified version of the emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task in which scenarios initially suggest negative interpretations that are later either confirmed or disconfirmed by additional information. Pupil dilation in response to the confirmatory and disconfirmatory information was recorded.ResultsBehavioral results showed that depressive symptoms were related to difficulties in revising negative interpretations despite disconfirmatory positive information. The eye tracking results pointed to a reduced pupil response to unexpected positive information among people with elevated depressive symptoms.DiscussionAltogether, the present study demonstrates that the adapted emotional BADE task can be appropriate for examining psychophysiological aspects such as changes in pupil size along with behavioral responses.

The purpose of the study was to identify important neuropsychological constructs and suitable tests for comprehending and addressing aggression.MethodsAn international panel of forensic neuropsychology experts participated in this three-round Delphi study consisting of iterative online questionnaires. The experts rated the importance of constructs based on the Research Domain Criteria framework. Subsequently, they suggested tests that can be used to assess these constructs and rated their suitability.ResultsThe panel identified the RDoC domains Negative Valence Systems, Social Processes, Cognitive Systems and Positive Valence Systems as most important in understanding aggression. Notably, the results underscore the significance of Positive Valence Systems in proactive aggression and Negative Valence Systems in reactive aggression. The panel suggested a diverse array of different tests, although they noted that not every RDoC construct can be effectively measured through a neuropsychological test. The added value of a multimodal assessment strategy is discussed.ConclusionsThis research advances our understanding of the RDoC constructs related to aggression and provides valuable insights for assessment strategies. Rather than suggesting a fixed set of tests, our study takes a flexible approach by presenting a top- list for each construct.

The DeltaQuest Reserve-Building Measure assessed current activities related to brain health. An analysis of variance and Pearson correlation coefficients assessed group differences in reserve-building activity scores. Classification and regression tree modeling investigated factors associated with higher and lower reported depression by employment group. The random effects models tested two buffering hypotheses: comparing all groups to the employed group and examining within-group effects.ResultsEngaging in outdoor activities, exercise, and religious/spiritual activities was associated with reduced depression over time in the overall sample. While disabled participants endorsed lower levels of being Active in the World, Outdoor activities, and Exercise and higher levels of Inner Life and Passive Media Consumption than the other employment groups, more reserve-building activities distinguished depression levels in the disabled group's CART models compared to the others. Among the disabled, unemployed, and retired participants, engaging in any reserve-building activities was also associated with lower depression scores, which was distinct from the employed participants. In the RE models that used the employed group as the reference category, only the disabled group's level of depression was buffered by engaging in creative activities. In the within-group RE models, the disabled group's engagement in Religious/Spiritual, Outdoors, and Games was associated with substantially reduced within-group depression, which was different from the other employment groups. In contrast, reserve-building activities were not implicated at all as buffers for employed participants.ConclusionThis study revealed a beneficial effect of reserve-building activities on buffering depression over time during the COVID- pandemic, particularly for disabled people. It documented that even if such individuals engaged in lesser amounts of such activities as compared to other employment groups, the buffering effect was substantial. Given the low-cost and accessible nature of reserve-building activities, it would be worthwhile to encourage such activities for disabled individuals."

These characteristics give rise to a number of issues, including the problematic generic use of the masculine grammatical gender, coupled with the challenge of sex categorization itself, and the epistemological difficulty of an adequate sociological description and analysis of what gender commonsense categories really are about. To remedy these concerns, several authors have proposed the creation of an additional, epicene grammatical gender. We have identified three such systematic proposals, or solutions, which specify various morphological options for new epicene nouns and gender markers on their satellite elements. These options include the use of non-standard or rarely used characters, the merging of feminine and masculine gender markers, as well as consonantal and vowel changes. In the simplest proposal, referred to as “solution I,” new epicene forms are mostly derived from feminine forms by systematically replacing with an i the final e that generally differentiates feminines from their masculine counterparts in written French. Although these solutions are used in some communities, their learnability has not been addressed so far, even though it could be a determining factor in their popularity and their eventual integration into standard French. In the present study, we provide a first assessment of this aspect by means of an online translation test. For each solution, French-speaking participants were instructed that they would be trained to learn an “alien” language that does not mark sex/gender categories . After a short learning-by-example phase, participants were required to translate into the alien language a set of standard French sentences. The translations were analyzed as a function of several variables including the participants’ self-reported age and sex, the word categories and the solutions themselves. While all solutions proved quickly learnable, participants’ responses with solution I achieved the highest accuracy score, in particular with regard to the production of non-standard epicene forms."

Based on previous evaluations we hypothesized that visual attention and working memory may be affected in a sample of cognitively impaired sepsis survivors.MethodsWe utilized psychophysical whole-and partial-report paradigms based on the computational theory of visual attention to determine whether sepsis survivors show changes in basic parameters of visual attention and working memory, whether the affected parameters are related to neuropsychological test results in a standard battery in sepsis survivors and matched healthy control participants, whether between-group differences in these basic parameters of visual attention could account for underperformance of sepsis survivors in neuropsychological tests when adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables.ResultsWe showed that, in sepsis survivors, the maximum number of elements consciously maintained in an instant, i.e. the working memory storage capacity K, is reduced . Moreover, K explained variance in neurocognitive outcomes –% in attentional and % in executive functions – in a standard neuropsychological battery. The association remained stable when adjusting for clinical variables.DiscussionThus, in our sample of cognitively impaired sepsis survivors, a reduction in working memory capacity seems to be a critical determinant of the neurocognitive sequelae. It should be the subject of future work on mechanisms but may also serve as surrogate outcome measure in interventional studies."

Neither the sequential organization of questions nor client resistance to questions have yet been investigated for this helping professional format. Client resistance is understood as a sequentially structured, locally emerging practice that may be accomplished in more passive or active forms, that in some way withdraw from, oppose, withstand or circumvent various interactional constraints set up by the coach’s question.Procedure and methodsDrawing on a corpus of systemic, solution-oriented business coaching processes and applying Conversation Analysis , the following research questions are addressed: How do clients display resistance to answering coaches’ wh-questions? How might these resistive actions be positioned along a passive/active, implicit/explicit or withdrawing/opposing continuum? Are certain linguistic/interactional features commonly used to accomplish resistance?.Results and discussionThe analysis of four dyadic coaching processes with a total of eleven sessions found various forms of client resistance on the active-passive continuum, though the more explicit, active, and agentive forms are at the center of our analysis. According to the existing resistance ‘action terminology’ , moving against or ‘opposing’ included ‘refusing to answer’, ‘complaining’ and ‘disagreeing with the question’s agenda and presuppositions’. However, alongside this, the analysis evinced clients’ refocusing practices to actively transform or deviate the course of action; a category which we have termed moving around."

However, across existing research there remains a limited understanding of the crucial perceptual attributes that inform audio quality evaluation for people with hearing loss, and those who use hearing aids. This is especially the case with music, given the unique problems it presents in contrast to human speech.MethodThis paper presents a sensory evaluation study utilising descriptive analysis methods, in which a panel of hearing aid users collaborated, through consensus, to identify the most important perceptual attributes of music audio quality and developed a series of rating scales for future listening tests. Participants , with a hearing loss ranging from mild to severe, first completed an online elicitation task, providing single-word terms to describe the audio quality of original and processed music samples; this was completed twice by each participant, once with hearing aids, and once without. Participants were then guided in discussing these raw terms across three focus groups, in which they reduced the term space, identified important perceptual groupings of terms, and developed perceptual attributes from these groups .ResultsFindings show that there were seven key perceptual dimensions underlying music audio quality , alongside a music audio quality attribute and possible alternative frequency balance attributes.DiscussionWe outline how these perceptual attributes align with extant literature, how attribute rating instruments might be used in future work, and the importance of better understanding the music listening difficulties of people with varied profiles of hearing loss."

The target stimuli were additively combined with a white noise field and were exposed very briefly . Target visibility oscillated randomly throughout exposure duration by manipulating the signal-to-noise ratio . Classification images based on response accuracy were calculated to reflect processing efficiency according to the time elapsed since target onset and the power of SNR oscillations in the – Hz range. CIs differed substantially across groups whereas individuals of the same group largely shared crucial features such that a machine learning algorithm reached % accuracy in classifying the data patterns of individual participants into their proper group. These findings demonstrate altered perceptual oscillations in healthy aging and are consistent with previous investigations showing brain oscillation anomalies in the elderly.

Whereas most previous studies on this issue focused on the receptive processing of FSs, few have investigated the productive processing of FSs, particularly in the second language learning context. Besides, most previous studies on L FSs examined learner-external FSs, or those identified by external criteria such as corpus frequency with little attention to learner-internal FSs, or psychological units perceived as wholes by learners themselves, although there might be much overlap between learner-external and learner-internal FSs. This study was designed to explore the productive processing of FSs by L learners from their own perspective, while taking into account the effects of L proficiency and topic familiarity. It made a distinction between internal FSs and purely external FSs as the primary criterion of categorizing learners’ processing behaviors. Ten Chinese English learners from two proficiency levels completed two writing tasks differing in topic familiarity. Upon the completion of each task, each participant and the researcher identified the FSs separately and then distinguished internal FSs and purely external FSs collectively. Next, each participant performed video stimulated recall for the production process of each FS. The results showed that the learners’ conscious processing of FSs can be categorized on two levels . There was more holistic processing than compositional processing on the lexical level, but not on the syntactic level, indicating the learners’ sizable storages of FSs and the syntactic flexibility of FSs. Furthermore, between-group differences and between-task differences were detected on two processing levels: higher-proficiency students retrieved more internal FSs and made more modifications to them than their lower-proficiency counterparts; in the familiar-topic writing, learners retrieved more internal FSs and made less modifications to them. Based on the findings, a model of L FS production is proposed, and pedagogical implications for the teaching of L FSs are provided."

As research in neuroscience can now explain how it connects to the processes of learning, its application and adaptation in pedagogy can now be explored. The aim of this mixed methods study was to investigate concepts of repetition and practice with mental training, and discuss adaptations for young violinists, to include attention, awareness, and creative musicality. Three exercises were developed with nine students . The first involved creation of imagery, followed by physical practice; the second alternated mental imagery with physical practice; the third involved concurrent use of physical practice and mental imagery. Results of the first exercise indicate heightened awareness of technical skill; self-discovery of bow control, speed and distribution, tone production improvements and an ability to sustain longer notes post-mental training . Observations from the second and third exercises include student experimentation with concepts of musical interpretation, an eagerness to repeat repertoire and increased self-awareness of technical and musical accomplishments.

This research paper therefore aims to address these gaps by qualitatively exploring the impact of COVID work throughout the pandemic on permanent and deployed personnel’s experiences, their ability to effectively work together, and the effect of social dynamics on teamwork and mental health.MethodsSeventy-five interviews were conducted across the UK between March and December during wave and of COVID- with healthcare workers who were either permanent staff on Intensive Care/High Dependency Units used as COVID wards, had been rapidly deployed to such a ward, or had managed such wards. Work Life Balance was measured using the WLB Scale. Interview transcripts were qualitatively coded and thematic codes were compared using network graph modeling.ResultsUsing thematic network analysis, four overarching thematic clusters were found, teamwork, organizational support and management, cohesion and social support, and psychological strain. The study has three main findings. First, the importance of social factors for teamwork and mental health, whereby team identity may influence perceptions of preparedness, collaboration and communication, and impact on the collective appraisal of stressful events and work stressors. Secondly, it demonstrates the positive and negative impact of professional roles and skills on the development of teamwork and team identity. Lastly the study identifies the more pronounced negative impact of COVID work on deployed personnel’s workload, mental health, and career intentions, exacerbated by reduced levels of social support during, and after, their deployment.ConclusionThe thematic network analysis was able to highlight that many of the traditional factors associated with the successful delivery of patient care were impeded by pandemic constraints, markedly influencing personnel’s ability to work together and cope with pandemic work stressors. In this environment teamwork, delivery of care and staff well-being appear to depend on relational and organizational context, social group membership, and psycho-social skills related to managing team identity. While results hold lessons for personnel selection, training, co-location, and organizational support during and after a pandemic, further research is needed into the differential impact of pandemic deployment on HCWs mental health and teamwork."

Accordingly, this study manipulated two syntactic variables, i.e., relative clause type and the position of the numeral-classifier sequence in the relative clause, as well as a semantic variable, i.e., the abstractness of the head noun that the relative clause modified. Specifically, the study addressed two questions: when semantics is activated and interacts with syntax and how semantics affects syntax during the time course of Chinese relative clause processing. The results indicated that: Semantics was activated and interacted with syntax during the early and late processing stages of Chinese relative clauses, which challenged the sequential order of syntactic and semantic processes, and supported the claims of the Concurrent Processing Model. The syntactic order of the Chinese relative clause was affected by the semantic information of the head noun that the clause modified. Object-extraction relative clauses had a conjunction preference for the order “an object relative clause preceding the numeral-classifier sequence and the head noun.” Instead, the subject-extraction relative clause which modified a concrete noun had a co-occurrence preference for the order “numeral-classifier sequence preceding the subject relative clause and the head noun,” while the subject-extraction relative clause which modified an abstract noun had a co-occurrence preference for the order “subject relative clause preceding the numeral-classifier sequence and the head noun.” The findings of this study were evaluated in light of the perspectives of truth value semantics of the syntactic components, the semantic compatibility of numeral-classifier sequence and its modified noun as well as the discourse functions of outer modifier nominals and inner modifier nominals."

This study aimed to examine the effects of a game-based virtual reality teaching method on secondary school students’ self-beliefs, interest, and performance in physics through a quasi-experimental design using pre- and post-test data. The evaluation is based on the systemic actiotope model that explains a person’s goal-oriented actions by an interplay of their environment, action repertoire , and subjective action space .MethodA game-based virtual reality App to be used with Google cardboards was developed containing teaching units from the secondary school physics class curriculum. Participants in the control group were taught using traditional teaching methods, while students in the experimental group went through the VR with the teacher and conducted the prepared VR experiments in addition to the traditionally presented content. Three tests measured students’ physics performance during the semester. In addition, students answered questionnaires assessing their interest, self-efficacy, self-concept, and entity implicit theories regarding physics before and after the intervention, resulting in a Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design.ResultsThere were no significant differences between the control and experimental group in test scores on the first and second tests but compared to the control group, the experimental group achieved higher scores on the third test. In addition, the results indicate differential effects of the game-based virtual reality teaching method on students’ interest and self-efficacy regarding physics to the advantage of students identifying as male, but no effects on students’ self-concept, and entity implicit theories regarding physics.DiscussionThe results of our pilot study suggest that incorporating innovative didactic methods into secondary school physics classes could potentially contribute to higher performance in and motivation for physics during this crucial period of adolescence when students develop educational and career aspirations. However, game-based virtual reality teaching methods seem to favor students identifying as male, which should be considered in their development and presentation. Other practical implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed."

The SSSC was administered through interviews with each child, wherein their responses to the SSSC questionnaire were recorded on a tablet.ResultsAnalysis of internal consistency reliability did not show acceptable reliability for all subscales, and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the Thrill Seeking and Behavioral Intensity subscales were associated and somewhat overlapping, while Behavioral Inhibition appeared as a single factor. A further explanatory factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution. CFA of the two-factor solution resulted in the removal of some items in both factors due to low factor loadings. The final factors resulting from this analysis were Thrill and Intensity Seeking and Behavioral Inhibition . The results also show that boys scored higher than girls on Thrill and Intensity Seeking while girls scored higher than boys on Behavioral Inhibition. Furthermore, age was positively associated with both subscales, meaning that older children tended to score higher.DiscussionThe results in this study suggest that measures of children’s sensation seeking might be sensitive to cultural contexts and that, at least in a Norwegian population, a two-factor solution of the SSSC is recommended."

While researchers have consistently underscored its capacity to improve student motivation in physical education, a gap remains concerning its implications in Arab nations. Moreover, no studies have been identified comparing the outcomes of SE between the U.S., where the model originated, and other countries.PurposeThis study was conducted to determine the impact of SE on Kuwaiti students' motivation, determine any differential effects of SE on Kuwaiti and American students' motivation, and explore students' perceptions of SE in both countries.MethodsA replicated mixed methods quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design was used. Participants were secondary school students from two classes in southwestern US, and secondary school students from two classes in Kuwait. Both sets of classes across the two countries were instructed by the same teacher who was trained in teaching SE. Student interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/importance, and pressure/tension were measured using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory instrument . Student perceptions of SE were assessed using a group Semi-structured interview. Quantitative data were analyzed using repeated measures and mixed ANOVAs followed by t-tests. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic analysis technique.ResultsKuwaiti students' perceived interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/importance, and pressure/tension scores significantly improved in the group that taught using SE only.

The adult attachment was assessed using the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised questionnaire, while hypnosis was assessed through the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility and the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory: Hypnotic Assessment Procedure in order to adopt a behavioral and a phenomenological approach, respectively.ResultsAnalyses showed that attachment factors were not associated with the level of hypnotizability, whereas it was associated with variations of consciousness during hypnosis, mainly internal dialogue, absorption and negative emotions. Overall, the insecure attachment styles yielded increased mind wandering and restlessness during hypnosis when compared to the secure style. The reason probably lies in the feeling of anxiety or danger of insecurely attached individuals when involved in intimate or confidential relationships.ConclusionThese findings clarify a still poorly investigated aspect concerning the influence of attachment style on hypnotic experience and further highlight the need to consider inter-individual differences and the phenomenological perspective when assessing hypnosis and hypnotizability."

This situation not only hinders the sustainable growth of these games but also limits the transmission of Chinese cultural heritage, a problem that demands urgent attention yet remains under-acknowledged. This study synthesizes literature to unearth user needs from three dimensions: motivational use, quality requirements of games, and continuous usage intention. It identifies influential factors, including cognitive satisfaction, immersion satisfaction, and achievement satisfaction. Drawing from the User Experience Rubric for Educational Games-CH evaluation rubric and the Delphi method, these factors are expanded into an evaluation system model comprising six primary indicators, secondary indicators, and tertiary indicators. The analytic hierarchy process is utilized for expert scoring to assign weights to each indicator. This is combined with the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to arrive at a final user score of Z = ., indicating that the evaluation rubric is close to ‘good’ and has received positive user feedback. Ultimately, this generates an evaluation rubric tailored to the specific context of serious games for cultural heritage. By integrating qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper confirms the scientific and rational nature of the evaluation rubric. The study aims to establish a user-approved rubric that encourages continuous usage intention, thereby providing effective guidance for game developers and assisting users in selecting appropriate games, while also addressing the theoretical gap in the field of evaluation for serious games related to cultural heritage."

Furthermore, this body of evidence heavily relies on cross-sectional studies. This study adopts an intensive longitudinal approach to assess psychological distress and its determinants among firefighters.MethodsParticipants were recruited from fire stations in Montreal, Canada, meeting specific criteria: full-time employment, smartphone ownership, and recent exposure to at least one PTE, or first responder status. Subjects underwent a telephone interview and were directed to use an app to report depressive, post-traumatic, and generalized anxiety symptoms every weeks, along with work-related stressors, social support, and coping styles. Analyses involved participants, distinguishing between those exceeding clinical thresholds in at least one distress measure and those deemed “resilient.” The duration and onset of distress were computed for the distressed group, and linear mixed models were employed to evaluate determinants for each psychological distress variable.ResultsClinical psychological distress was observed in .% of participants, marked by depressive, post-traumatic, and anxiety symptoms, often within the first -week reference period. Contextual factors and individual factors exhibited more significant impacts on psychological distress than professional pressures within the firefighters’ work environment.DiscussionThis study reports lower rates of psychological distress than previous research, possibly attributable to sample differences. It highlights that reported symptoms often represent a combined and transient layer of distress rather than diagnosable mental disorders.

Short fixations and long saccades during early viewing periods are classified as ambient mode of vision, which is concerned with spatial orientation and is related to simple visual properties such as motion, contrast, and location. Longer fixations and shorter saccades during later viewing periods are classified as focal mode of vision, which is concentrated in the foveal projection and is capable of object identification and its semantic categorization. While these findings are mainly obtained in the context of image exploration, the present study endeavors to investigate whether the same pattern of interplay between ambient and focal visual attention is deployed when people work on complex real-world tasks—and if so, when? Based on a re-analysis of existing data that integrates concurrent think aloud and eye tracking protocols, the present study correlated participants’ internal thinking models to the parameters of their eye movements when they planned solutions to an open-ended design problem in a real-world setting. We hypothesize that switching between ambient and focal attentional processing is useful when solvers encounter difficulty compelling them to shift their conceptual direction to adjust the solution path. Individuals may prefer different attentional strategies for information-seeking behavior, such as ambient-to-focal or focal-to-ambient. The observed increase in fixation durations and decrease in saccade amplitudes during the periods around shifts in conceptual direction lends support to the postulation of the ambient-to-focal processing; however, focal-to-ambient processing is not evident. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the beginning of a shift in conceptual direction is observable in eye movement behavior with a significant prolongation of fixation. Our findings add to the conclusions drawn from laboratory settings by providing preliminary evidence for ambient and focal processing characteristics in real-world problem-solving."

Additionally, based on conservation of resources theory, when experiencing psychologically taxing events, skillful emotional support provided by leaders may help to replenish staff’s depleted psychological resources, promoting staff well-being. In two national studies, a cross-sectional and a two-wave study , we tested the association between United States preK- educator perceptions of school leaders’ ER and ES with educator well-being before and during the COVID- pandemic, employing structural equation modeling and multilevel modeling. In Studies and , educator reports of their leaders’ ER and ES skills predicted greater educator well-being, including higher positive affect and job satisfaction and lower emotional exhaustion and turnover intentions. In moderation analyses, perceived leader ER predicted well-being about equally among educators facing severe versus mild health impacts from COVID-. In contrast, perceived leader ES was more strongly associated with educator well-being for some outcomes in those severely versus mildly impacted by COVID- illness and death. Leader ER played a role in the well-being of everyone, whereas leader ES was more predictive of well-being for those severely impacted by a crisis. Regarding implications for policy and practice, efforts to promote well-being among educators may be enhanced when combined with efforts to develop school leaders’ ER and ES skills, especially in times of crisis.

However, research suggests that accumulated emotion concept knowledge shapes the way people perceive the emotional meaning of others’ facial muscle movements. Cultural upbringing can shape an individual’s concept knowledge, such as expectations about which facial muscle configurations convey anger, disgust, or sadness. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that access to emotion category words, such as “anger,” facilitates access to such emotion concept knowledge and in turn facilitates emotion perception.MethodsTo investigate the impact of cultural influence and emotion concept accessibility on emotion perception, participants from two cultural groups completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning session to assess functional connectivity between brain regions during emotion perception. Across four blocks, participants were primed with either English emotion category words or control text before viewing images of White American actors posing facial muscle configurations that are stereotypical of anger and disgust in the United States.ResultsWe found that when primed with “disgust” versus control text prior to seeing disgusted facial expressions, Chinese participants showed a significant decrease in functional connectivity between a region associated with semantic retrieval and regions associated with semantic processing, visual perception, and social cognition. Priming the word “anger” did not impact functional connectivity for Chinese participants relative to control text, and priming neither “disgust” nor “anger” impacted functional connectivity for White American participants.DiscussionThese findings provide preliminary evidence that emotion concept accessibility differentially impacts perception based on participants’ cultural background."

There were no differences between groups in gender, ""Low Risk"" motive, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression scores, trait anxiety scores, self-reported prevalence of substance use related disorders, and past consumption of alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine .The current study demonstrates a difference in age and motivations for cannabis consumption between recreational and medical cannabis users, but also shows areas of potential overlap including mental health outcomes, past substance use, and gender. These UK-specific findings indicate that recreational cannabis users experience higher state anxiety highlighting the need for further evaluation of potential anxiogenic/anxiolytic properties of cannabis. These findings demonstrate the importance of researching individual differences in cannabis users, and hold significant implications for future research, clinical practice, and legislation."

Reading engagement is one of the important student characteristics related to reading literacy, which is highly malleable and is jointly reflected by behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement, and it is of theoretical and practical significance to explore the relationship between reading engagement and scientific literacy using reading engagement as an entry point. In this study, we used PISA data from China to explore the relationship between reading engagement and scientific literacy with a sample of -year-old students in mainland China. variables related to reading engagement and background variables were selected from the questionnaire as the independent variables, and the score of the Scientific Literacy Assessment was taken as the outcome variable, and supervised machine learning method, the XGBoost algorithm, to construct the model. The dataset is randomly divided into training set and test set to optimize the model, which can verify that the obtained model has good fitting degree and generalization ability. Meanwhile, global and local personalized interpretation is done by introducing the SHAP value, a cutting-edge machine model interpretation method. It is found that among the three major components of reading engagement, cognitive engagement is the more influential factor, and students with high reading cognitive engagement level are more likely to get high scores in scientific literacy assessment, which is relatively dominant in the model of this study. On the other hand, this study verifies the feasibility of the current popular machine learning model, i.e., XGBoost, in a large-scale international education assessment program, with a better model adaptability and conditions for global and local interpretation."

However, previous research and theories primarily examined the development of children’s fairness behaviors in the conflict between self-interest motivation and fairness-complying motivation, neglecting the influence of advantage-seeking motivation. Moreover, despite the well-established role of gain/loss frame in human decision-making, it remains largely unclear whether the framing effect modulates fairness behaviors in children. It was hypothesized that children would exhibit advantage-seeking motivation resulting in more selfish behaviors in the loss context. To examine the hypothesis, we combined an adapted dictator game and computational modeling to investigate various motivations underlying fairness behaviors of children in both loss and gain contexts and to explore the developmental directions by contrasting children and adults. In addition, the current design enabled the dissociation between fairness knowledge and behaviors by asking participants to decide for themselves or for others . This study recruited a total of children and college students . The behavioral results indicated that children behaved more selfishly in first-party and more fairly in third-party than adults, without any significant framing effects. The computational results revealed that both children and adults exhibited aversion to advantageous and disadvantageous inequity in third-party. However, they showed distinct preferences for advantageous inequity in first-party, with advantage-seeking preferences among children and aversion to advantageous inequity among adults. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of children’s social preferences and their developmental directions."

Multilevel regression analyses were performed using Mplus to investigate whether students’ LAL proficiency can predict their levels of test anxiety and motivation.ResultsThe findings indicated that the participating students had a proficiency level of approximately % in the content of the LAL questionnaire. The analysis further revealed the relationships between specific dimensions of LAL and both test anxiety and second language motivation. The multilevel regression analysis suggested that theoretical knowledge about language and language learning, the understanding of the impact and social value of language assessments, and the uses of assessments to enhance learning, positively predicted students’ extrinsic motivation. Furthermore, students’ understanding of the uses of assessments to learn and their theoretical knowledge about language learning were identified as positive predictors of intrinsic motivation. Additionally, it was observed that students’ LAL did not significantly predict test anxiety.DiscussionThese findings emphasize the significance of enhancing students’ LAL due to the identified relationships between LAL dimensions and motivation to learn a second language. The study suggests pedagogical implications for improving LAL, with a focus on specific dimensions that positively impact students’ motivation. The absence of a significant relationship between LAL dimensions and test anxiety prompts further exploration and consideration of additional factors influencing students’ anxiety in language assessments."

Because parental leave is discussed as a gateway to increasing men’s childcare engagement, we aimed to gain insights into predictors of men’s parental leave-taking intentions during the transition to parenthood. Using outcomes on a continuum from behavioral preferences to more behavior-oriented measures, we examine how masculinity and fatherhood beliefs as well as social support become relevant during men’s formation of their leave-taking intentions. Planned analyses of data collected from expectant fathers in Belgium and Germany revealed that the support men perceive from their partners for taking leave predicts their parental leave-taking desire, intention, and planned length of leave. Moreover, men’s conception of a prototypical man, especially in terms of agency, was linked to their desire to take leave. Against expectations, father role attitudes and workplace support did not emerge as relevant predictors of men’s intended leave-taking. Results of exploratory analyses suggest that care engagement of peers, expected backlash, and self-efficacy beliefs additionally play a role in men’s intended leave-taking. We discuss parental leave as a negotiation process within couples and review the role of men’s normative environment for their intended leave-taking."

The transdiagnostic skills scale was developed recently to assess the skills that are disrupted in these disorders. However, studies have shown that the TS has lower predictive power for externalizing than internalizing disorders. This may be due to the fact that the skills assessed do not include the control of urges and cravings. The aims of the current study are thus to develop a revised version of the TS integrating this dimension, and to assess its factor structure and invariance across employment status and the level of psychopathology.MethodWe recruited , French participants online through social media. They completed the revised version of the TS and the symptomatic transdiagnostic test , which evaluates clusters of psychiatric symptoms. We assessed the factor structure, internal consistency, invariance, and predictive validity of the revised TS.ResultsWe found a good fit for a bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling approach including a global skills factor and seven specific factors. The results also indicate that the new dimension has good predictive value, especially for externalizing problems. We also found total invariance of the scale across employment status and partial invariance across the level of psychopathology.ConclusionThe revised version of the TS-R has good psychometric properties. It predicts better externalizing problems than the original version. However, the scale remains more correlated with internalizing than externalizing problems. We discuss the implications of the results on the transdiagnostic conceptualization and the interest of using a mixed approach combining transdiagnostic and diagnostic analyses."

The present study analyzed the interplay of trait and state self-control and time perception tendencies and how it influences the rates of selecting immediate options in both gain and loss situations by conducting an intertemporal choice task. Experiment was used to explore the impact of trait self-control and time perception on intertemporal choices within gain and loss situations. In Experiment , the e-crossing task was used to induce self-control resource depletion in participants and to investigate the impact of self-control resources and time perception on intertemporal choices in gain and loss situations. The results indicate that compared with the high-self-control group, the low-self-control group exhibited a greater tendency to choose immediate options. Additionally, the high time estimation group was more likely to opt for immediate choices than the low time estimation group was. Furthermore, participants were more likely to select immediate options in the loss situation than in the gain situation. In the gain situation, the high time estimation group was more likely to choose immediate options than was the low time estimation group. However, in the loss situation, the difference between the two groups was nonsignificant. Time perception and gain–loss situations exerted a moderating mediating effect on the impact of self-control resources on intertemporal choices. These findings shed light on the influence of both self-control abilities and self-control resources on intertemporal choices. They provide valuable insights into intertemporal decision behaviors across diverse contexts and indicate the need for rational analysis based on one’s current state to mitigate cognitive biases to ensure individuals can maximize benefits in their daily lives."

We measured these constructs using the planfulness scale, an ad-hoc survey item probing goal disruption in the pandemic, the perceived stress scale, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, respectively. Participants were university students . Higher planfulness predicted lower goal-disruption, lower stress, and higher well-being during the pandemic, extending its benefits beyond the goal domain. High levels of planfulness did not protect against goal disruption among those participants in which the self-reported personal impact of the pandemic was highest. Differences in goal disruption across levels of planfulness were constrained to lower reported pandemic impact. However, the differences in psychological well-being and stress by levels of planfulness were retained even when self-reported perceptions of personal pandemic impact were high.

Previous studies on the relationship between public sentiment and urban built environmental factors have yielded meaningful results. However, few studies have focused on the effect of micro-built environment on public sentiment at the street level, which directly shapes people’s perceptions. In addition, the nonlinear relationship and synergistic effect among urban built environmental factors have been commonly disregarded in previous studies, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the impact of urban built environment on public emotions. Therefore, this paper takes San Francisco as a study case to explore the complex relationship between urban built environmental factors and public emotions. Specifically, this paper measures the polarity of public emotions through sentiment analysis on Twitter data, establishes a comprehensive built environment index system from both macro- and micro- perspectives, and subsequently explores the complex relationship between the urban built environment and public sentiment through the OLS model and Shapley Additive Explanation algorithm. Results show that: micro-built environmental factors have a significant influence on public emotion, although they have been frequently ignored. Public sentiment tends to be more positive in areas with recreation facilities, mixed land use, rich street view visual environment, suitable thermal and acoustic environment, balanced income, and a suitable degree of high population density. A nonlinear relationship and threshold effect exist between the built environmental variables and the semantic orientations of public emotion. Environment improvement strategies based on the synergic effect between variables can effectively promote the generation of positive emotions. Our empirical findings can offer valuable insights to promote feelings of well-being and foster an urban development approach through strategic interventions within the urban built environment."

This study presents a framework to evaluate the impact of personality traits on the formation of echo chambers. Using Weibo and Twitter as platforms, we first define an echo chamber as a network where users interact solely with those sharing their opinions, and quantify echo chamber effects through selective exposure and homophily. We then employ an unsupervised personality recognition method to assign a personality model to each user, and compare the distribution differences of echo chambers and personality traits across platforms and topics. Our findings show that, although user personality trait models exhibit similar distributions between topics, differences exist between platforms. Among personality model combinations, over % of Weibo echo chamber members are “ynynn” models, while over % of Twitter echo chamber members are “nnnny” models. This indicates significant differences in personality traits among echo chamber members between platforms. Specific personality traits attract like-minded individuals to engage in discussions on particular topics, ultimately forming homogeneous communities.

In this quasi-experimental study, we evaluate the effectiveness of the paradigm to investigate reactive aggression in interacting participants. The design allows us to employ the TAP in settings of high familiarity dyads, addressing an existing gap.MethodTwenty-eight healthy same-sex adult sibling pairs competed against each other in the iTAP, exemplifying high familiarity through their social and emotional co-development, and mutual knowledge. Additionally, we explore naturally arising aggression types in terms of sibling pairs’ reciprocal aggression trajectories across trials. Lastly, we investigate situational and personal variables influencing reactive aggression on the iTAP within high familiarity dyads.ResultsIn line with non-interactive TAP versions, siblings employed a global “tit-for-tat” strategy in response to heightened provocation: Aggression increased during manipulated trials of increasing provocation, persisted during real interaction and declined in the final block, suggesting sibling co-regulation which was underscored by the convergence in within-pair aggression level. We found no gender differences in these dynamics but a trend for higher initial aggression levels within brother pairs and higher responsiveness to increased provocation in sister pairs. Overall aggression levels were related to situational variables including trial outcome , Further, siblings’ state anger correlated positively with aggression scores on the iTAP. Aggression was not reliably related to personal variables predicting aggression. We identified subgroups of sibling pairs with distinct provocation-aggression patterns related to differences in reported behavioral motivations and emotional states. The results highlight situational over personal variables in determining aggressive behavior on the task in this sample of healthy adults. While no direct link between sibling relationship quality and aggression was found, the overall behavior was likely influenced by the familiarity between siblings and the specific context of their relationship.ConclusionThe iTAP demonstrates promise as a tool for studying reciprocal aggressive behavior.

Gender, personal health condition, family socio-economic status, and weekly time spent on physical activities significantly predicted initial levels of physical habitus, whereas family social economic status significantly predicted the rate of change in physical habitus simultaneously.DiscussionThese findings not only support the participation in sport is constructed socially but also that individual efforts and contextual influences contribute to physical habitus. Furthermore, three types of perceived influences intertwined so much in simultaneity, instead of contributing to physical habitus across time."

Recent studies on working memory reported the impact of sex on brain connectivity patterns, which reflect the important role of functional connectivity in the sex topic. Working memory, one of the most important cognitive tasks performed by regions of the PFC, can provide evidence regarding the presence of a difference between males and females. The present study aimed to assess sex differences in brain functional connectivity during working memory-related tasks by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy . In this regard, nine males and nine females completed a dual n-back working memory task with two target inputs of color and location stimuli in three difficulty levels . Functional connectivity matrices were extracted for each subject for each memory load level. Females made less errors than males while spending more time performing the task for all workload levels except in -back related to the color stimulus, where the reaction time of females was shorter than males. The results of functional connectivity reveal the inverse behavior of two hemispheres at different memory workload levels between males and females. In the left hemisphere, males exhibited stronger connectivity compared to the females, while stronger connectivity was observed in the females' right hemisphere. Furthermore, an inverse trend was detected in the channel pairs with significant connectivity in the right hemisphere of males and females by enhancing working memory load level. Considering both behavioral and functional results for two sexes demonstrated a better performance in females due to the more effective use of the brain. The results indicate that sex affects functional connectivity between different areas in both hemispheres of the brain during cognitive tasks of varying difficulty levels although the general impression is that spatial capabilities are considered as a performance of the brain's right hemisphere. These results reinforce the presence of a sex effect in the functional imaging studies of hemodynamic function and emphasize the importance of evaluating brain network connectivity for achieving a better scientific understanding of sex differences."

Stress has been considered the main factor in the etiology of many diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, and body aches for centuries. Students meet many stressful situations such as the need for success, academic demands, homesickness, and lack of social support. Coping with stress can be a leading cause in preventing psychological distress and a serious illness.MethodsA correlational cross-sectional approach was applied to the current research. The research targeted all secondary school male students in Abha city. A multistage cluster sample was applied by selecting schools and students from the Directorate of Education in Abha. Self-administered questionnaire sheets were distributed to students in their classes. The questionnaire covered students’ sociodemographic data such as age, grades, parents’ education and work, living conditions, and comorbidities. Stressors to which the students were exposed were also enumerated with the degree of stress for each. Stress was assessed using the Holmes–Rahe Stress Inventory for youth. Coping skills were measured using the abbreviated version of the COPE Inventory.ResultsThe study included students whose ages ranged from to years old with a mean age of ± . years old. Approximately % of the students were in first grade; .% of the students had no or minimal level of stress while major stress was recorded among .% of the students. In total, .% of the students had moderate coping and none had high coping ability.ConclusionThe study revealed that more than half of the students had significant levels of stress and one out of each four had major stress. The most common stressors were due to the school environment and future planning. Young age, low socioeconomic status, parents’ separation, and having chronic health problems were the most important determinants of stress among the students."

The present study investigated whether prolonged experience with distractors that were all novel was effective in shaping the attentional filter, favoring stable and generalizable inhibition effects.MethodsTo test this, the impact of emotional distractors was measured before and after a sustained training phase with only novel distractor pictures, and that for a group of participants depicted only a variety of neutral contents, whereas a different group was exposed only to emotional contents.ResultsResults showed that emotional interference on reaction times was attenuated after the training phase , but emotional distractors continued to interfere more than neutral ones in the post-test. The two groups did not differ in terms of training effect, suggesting that the distractor suppression mechanism developed during training was not sensitive to the affective category of natural scenes with which one had had experience. The affective modulation of neither the LPP or Alpha-ERD showed any effect of training.DiscussionAltogether, these findings suggest that sustained experience with novel distractors may attenuate attention allocation toward task irrelevant emotional stimuli, but the evaluative processes and the engagement of motivational systems are always needed to support the monitoring of the environment for significant cues."

Additionally, the study examined the relationship of various cognitive abilities to TBPM performance through the use of appropriate cognitive tasks.ResultsThe first signs of TBPM were observed in children as young as years old. No significant age differences were identified; preschoolers can perform a delayed intention on their own initiative at a certain point in the future only to a minimal extent. The majority of variance in TBPM performance could be explained by time checking behavior.ConclusionThe current study indicated that even -year-olds can perform TBPM at a basic level when the task is sufficiently understandable.

However, because no measurement instrument has yet been published that specifically refers to self-efficacy beliefs regarding the task of teaching SR, we adapted the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument accordingly, resulting in the Teaching Scientific Reasoning Efficacy Beliefs Instrument . While the conceptual framework of the TSR-EBI is comparable to that of the STEBI in general terms, it goes beyond it in terms of specificity, acknowledging the fact that teaching SR requires very specific knowledge and skills that are not necessarily needed to the same extent for promoting other competencies in science education. To evaluate the TSR-EBI's psychometric quality, we conducted two rounds of validation. Both samples consisted of pre-service teachers enrolled in university master's programs in Germany. The collected data were analyzed by applying Rasch analysis and known-group comparisons. In the course of an analysis of the TSR-EBI's internal structure, we found a -category scale to be superior to a -category structure. The person and item reliability of the scale proved to be satisfactory. Furthermore, during the second round of validation, it became clear that the results previously found for the -category scale were generally replicable across a new sample, which clearly supports the TSR-EBI's psychometric quality. Moreover, in terms of test-criterion relationships, the scale was also able to discriminate between groups that are assumed to have different levels of self-efficacy regarding teaching SR. Nonetheless, some findings also suggest that the scale might benefit from having the selection of individual items reconsidered . On balance, however, we believe that the TSR-EBI has the potential to provide valuable insights in future studies regarding factors that influence teachers' self-efficacy, such as their professional experiences, prior training, or perceived barriers to effective teaching."

The last few decades have seen a huge demand for international education in China, and numerous acclaimed international brand names set up operations in China’s K schooling sector. However, the COVID- pandemic exerted a noticeably negative impact on international high schools and their staff in China, and exacerbated a difficult period of management for these institutions. Interestingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the actual operation of these educational workplaces remains under investigated in academic studies. This paper therefore attempts to examine international high schools in China by focusing on their teachers and their associated employment motivation, job satisfaction, and dissatisfaction which has been perceptibly influenced by the impact of the COVID- pandemic. Through a qualitative, case-study approach which adopted semi-structured interviews, an acclaimed British high school, now closed, was investigated. The study found that international high school teachers were driven by diverse work motives such as the school’s reputation, values, salary, environment, and chances for career development. Their job satisfaction was also multi-faceted, and their dissatisfaction in certain areas concerning. That is, they derived an early satisfaction from a range of facets, such as the students, class sizes, initial workloads, autonomy and collegiality. However, these early feelings were replaced by a sense of dissatisfaction and noticeable unhappiness resulting from leadership changes and subsequent management practices, increased workload, unmet employment package expectations and obligations, as well as limited professional development opportunities. This study highlights the importance of recruiting well, generating the right starting and longer-term conditions, retaining key staff and managing astutely. The work will be of interest to policy makers, investors, leaders, managers and staff alike. It will also extend educational research in the areas of teacher motivation, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and in particular in China in international K settings."

Employing a fusion of the UTAUT model and the ECM , the research seeks to pinpoint the pivotal factors influencing students’ attitudes, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions regarding AI Chatbots. The study constructs a model comprising seven substantial predictors aimed at precisely foreseeing users’ intentions and behavior with AI Chatbots. Collected from students enrolled in various universities across China, the self-reported data is subject to analysis using the partial-least squares method of structural equation modeling to confirm the model’s reliability and validity. The findings validate seven out of the eleven proposed hypotheses, underscoring the influential role of ECM constructs, particularly “Confirmation” and “Satisfaction,” outweighing the impact of UTAUT constructs on users’ behavior. Specifically, users’ perceived confirmation significantly influences their satisfaction and subsequent intention to continue using AI Chatbots.

Recently, it has been described as an unrepeated act in which a person expresses unsolicited, mostly negative comments about an individual’s body. The targeted person perceives these comments as negative, offensive or body shame-inducing. Empirical evidence also suggests that body weight is the most common reason that youths are teased and bullied. Indeed, weight stigma, described as bias or discriminatory behaviors, attitudes, feelings, and thinking about individuals, because of their weight, can lead to weight-based discrimination and victimization. Preliminary evidence suggests that BS and weight stigma have negative effects on psychological health both in the short and long term. In the delicate stage of adolescence development and pubertal maturation, BS experiences can be highly prevalent and it can lead to adverse outcomes such as eating disorders . However, prevalence data in the Italian context are still lacking.MethodsThe study aims to estimate weight-related BS perceived by different sources and their associations with public and internalized weight bias, body mass index , body dissatisfaction, and ED symptoms. A sample of high school students completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing these variables.ResultsOne in four students reported experiences of weight-related BS by peers or family members. A total of % reported having at least one BS experience in a lifetime. Higher scores of ED symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and weight bias were reported by adolescents who experienced BS, especially females. Among overweight participants, results showed that internalized weight bias partially mediated the relationship between BS by family members and ED symptoms and fully mediated the relationship between BS by peers and ED symptoms, after controlling for age, sex and BMI.DiscussionThese findings, despite their cross-sectional nature, add an important contribution to the creation of quantitative empirical evidence on the phenomenon of BS. Its role in explaining eating disorders, both alone and with the mediation of internalized weight stigma has been first proved and needs to be confirmed by longitudinal results."

Clinical information was collected from the online survey and medical records. Descriptive statistics were carried out followed by regression analyses.ResultsOf participants, .% were unwilling to quit the TMs test in AHEs, whereas .% would take the doctor’s advice and quit unnecessary TMs test; .% felt stressed about their TMs. Among participants with elevated TMs, .% changed lifestyle to keep healthy, .% sought health information, .% requested a TMs retest, and .% did further tests to confirm a diagnosis. Family history of cancer was associated with lifestyle changing; education level, area of residence and health insurance were associated with health information seeking; comorbidity were associated with retests and sequential confirming tests.ConclusionThe application of the TMs test in AHEs among Chinese people may lead to positive and negative behavioral consequences and psychological distress. Doctors have a significant impact on patients’ health behaviors. Accurate indications and adequate communication with patients before and after the TMs test are in great need."

SAPAS is one of the most rapid tools for assessing personality disorder and has excellent sensitivity and good specificity, whereas other PD assessment tools require such a significant investment of time that they are infeasible for large surveys or routine clinical practice. Customary assessment in clinical practice ideally incorporates screening for PD, as it is associated with a substantial public health burden, including premature mortality and increased health service utilization. Furthermore, PD’s status as a key prognostic variable of mental disorders also drives PD screening. While SAPAS has been translated into several languages, there has been no Japanese version. Therefore, we translated SAPAS into Japanese and evaluated its reliability and validity. Study recruited undergraduates to reveal its test–retest reliability. Although its internal consistency was not high, since the intent of the original SAPAS was to assess the broad character of personality disorder with the fewest possible items, minimal correlations between items were reasonable. We tested two factorial models, the single-factor model and the higher-order-single-factor model, and the latter offered better fitting. This higher-order model contained a three-factor structure corresponding to clusters described in DSM-. It measures general PD traits as a common higher-order latent variable comprising those factors. Correlations of SAPAS-J with the much longer PD screening questionnaire in Study and depressive and anxiety symptoms in Study from the general population support its validity. Although validation for the clinical use of SAPAS-J is limited, our research with non-clinical populations demonstrated sufficient validity to justify its use in the context of psychopathological analog research. Since PD is understood as a continuum, the severity of which is distributed dimensionally, the analog study recruiting from the general population and attempting to reveal psychopathological mechanisms of PD is meaningful."

This study aimed to evaluate mood disorders and associated factors in general surgery inpatients using the Huaxi Emotional Distress Index .MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed HEI scores of , adult patients hospitalized for elective surgery at a tertiary hospital in China . Univariable and multivariable logistic regression identified factors linked to moderate/severe mood disturbances.ResultsFactors linked to moderate/severe mood disturbances were identified through univariable and multivariable logistic regression. The results showed that .% of the patients had HEI ≥ , indicating significant emotional issues. The mean age was . years in the group with no/mild distress and . years in the group with moderate/severe distress. Among all the cases included, there were , cases of gastric and esophageal diseases, , cases of hepatic diseases, cases of periampullary and pancreatic tumors, , cases of gallbladder diseases, , cases of colorectal diseases, and , cases of other diseases. The male percentage was . and .% in the two groups, respectively. Older age, male gender, unstable occupations, lower education, and unmarried status were associated with higher risks of mood disturbances . A significant downward trend in adverse emotions was observed with increasing education levels . Furthermore, the study found that the inpatients had higher HEI scores prior to the COVID- pandemic compared to during the pandemic . However, the occurrence of adverse mood states in these patients was not exacerbated by the COVID- pandemic. The trend test remained highly significant in the none-adjusted, age-sex adjusted, and fully adjusted models .ConclusionThe implementation of routine screening in higher education institutions allows for the early identification of surgical inpatients who require psychological intervention. It is recommended that counseling services focus on individuals with lower levels of education and income instability in order to address negative mood states. Furthermore, the potential application of this screening system in other clinical settings could enable earlier psychological interventions for a larger number of patients."

However, much of the empirical validation of this theory has been conducted within predominantly White samples, resulting in a limited understanding of how the theory applies to Black sexual minority individuals. Current examinations of social support fail to capture the nuances of how Black sexual minority men may access support systems differently, resulting in a need to investigate how social support, IH, and mental health operate for Black sexual minority men. This study examined relationships between IH, depression, and different types of social support using a mediation model.MethodsWe used data from the POWER Study, which recruited Black sexual minority men at Black Pride events across six cities in the United States from to , to test four mediation pathways concurrently in Stata . Participants completed a questionnaire assessing a variety of health and life domains, including depression symptoms, internalized homophobia, and social support.ResultsIH was positively associated with depression. Lower levels of family, friend, and Black community support were all positively associated with depression symptoms. Additionally, IH was positively associated with all types of support. Finally, family, friend, and Black community support partially mediated the relationship between IH and depression.Conclusions and implicationsResults suggest that the relationship between social support and depression is complex for Black sexual minority men. Findings suggest family support is an important factor for clinical intervention efforts targeting depression, and that gay community support systems should assess how their environments can better support Black sexual minority men. Overall, findings demonstrate the necessity of future examination of how social support functions differently within Black sexual minority communities."

Research further shows that, in religious-secular heterogeneous family groups, there is a significant distance between the religious parent and their teenagers in terms of religious values. The purpose of this study is to explore the transmission of religious values in homogeneous Modern-Orthodox family groups and in heterogeneous Modern-Orthodox-secular family groups in Israel. Results of the study show that religious distance in values is not dependent on the family type . However, it appears that, when the transmitter of religious values is a religious parent in both homogeneous and heterogeneous religious and religious-secular family groups, there is a distance in the socialization of religious values between religious parent and their children. Moreover, the study proposes that the effect sizes are smaller in the parent-child religious distance of values in homogeneous Modern-Orthodox family groups in comparison to the parent child religious distance of values in heterogeneous Modern-Orthodox-secular family groups.

Nevertheless, it would be helpful for many patients to complement the therapeutic treatment with acceptance strategies to further increase the therapeutic benefit. The aim of the present study was to examine neurobiological responses to acceptance and intensification strategies during symptom provocation alongside the psychotherapeutic process.MethodA total of patients diagnosed with OCD was instructed to utilise either an acceptance strategy or an intensification strategy to cope with their emotional and cognitive reactions to personalised symptom-triggering and neutral pictures. Fourteen patients participated twice: at the beginning [T] and at the end [T] of an inpatient multimodal treatment including cognitive behaviour therapy with response prevention to assess functional variations.ResultsFor the contrast of T and T, ACS showed increased brain activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus , left caudate body, and posterior cingulate gyrus . They also showed decreased activity in the left anterior insula. INS showed decreased activation in right lingual gyrus and right caudate body. At T, ACS showed increased activation compared to INS in the left cerebrum: IFG, caudate nucleus, middle and superior temporal gyrus, and PCC/cuneus. For the comparison of T and T, the ACS revealed increased brain activity in the left IFG, left caudate body, and right inferior parietal lobe. It showed decreased activity in the left anterior insula. The INS revealed decreased activity in right lingual gyrus and right caudate body.The psychometric questionnaires suggested that patients were able to reduce obsession, compulsion, and depression symptoms. Furthermore, patients rated the ACS as more useful for themselves compared with the INS.ConclusionThe increased left IFG activity using ACS could be interpreted as a better inhibitory top-down process, while the increased PCC response might be due to a better reappraisal strategy after therapy. ACS seems to mobilise neuronal activations under therapy, especially in the left hemisphere. Both strategies showed reductions in emotional networks as a neuronal correlate of therapy success.

Children completed an implicit association task, a short questionnaire on explicit stereotypes, and a chronometric mental rotation task. Preschool-aged children held explicit gender stereotypes about spatial ability linking it to boys rather than girls. Boys exhibited stronger stereotypes in this regard than girls. We also found evidence for the presence of implicit stereotypes. However, implicit stereotypes were not found in sub-group analyses. No clear relationship between stereotypes and mental rotation performance emerged, but our results suggest that implicit stereotyping affected mental rotation accuracy differently in girls compared with boys.

Although there have been numerous studies on resilience competencies in the military, there is a research gap when it comes to identifying the most essential competencies that should be prioritized in training programs, particularly within compressed timeframes. With the current geopolitical landscape and ongoing military conflicts in Europe, it is necessary to expedite training of soldiers, including resilience training, without compromising the effectiveness of the program. This study aims to address this research gap by using a reductionist approach to resilience training and identifying the critical competencies that senior soldiers need to be trained to coach younger soldiers to maintain psychological strength during deployment. By filling this research gap, the study will contribute to the development of more efficient and targeted resilience training programs that optimize the ability of soldiers to adapt and excel in challenging military environments.MethodsTo address the issue, this study assessed the competencies comprising the master resilience training program, widely recognized as one of the most effective military resilience training programs. Two groups of military experts, totaling individuals, were involved in the evaluation process, representing two military contexts. The first group consisted of Ukrainian military experts whose experiences primarily focused on defending their own country’s territory. The second group comprised Lithuanian military experts who had greater expertise in conducting military missions abroad. The assessment of resilience competencies was carried out using a deep analysis approach through the application of effective multi-criteria decision making . Specifically, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method was used, which is a significant multicriteria technique used to determine relationships among criteria and assign weight coefficients. In this study, the DEMATEL model was extended using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to accommodate decision-making under uncertainty conditions.ResultsThe research findings highlight the critical importance of three core resilience competencies: self-regulation, mental agility and strength of character. The importance of each competency varies depending on the specific military context. When defending one’s own country’s territory, strength of character emerges as the key factor in enhancing soldiers’ mental resilience. Conversely, during military operations abroad, self-regulation is the primary factor that promotes psychological resilience. Furthermore, the results show that these three primary competencies form a ‘cause group’ that influences other competencies through a cause-and-effect dependency.ConclusionBased on the findings, the theoretical conclusion is drawn that the importance of resilience competencies is contextually differentiated. Furthermore, each resilience competency is associated with a set of causes or effects. These are valuable insights for improving resilience competency training programs."

The approach taken within different healthcare networks has brought about a reform in healthcare facilities in Quebec, leading to several mergers and eliminating over , managerial positions. As a result, this has placed a progressively heavier workload on the shoulders of the remaining managers. Research on mental health in the workplace has mainly focused with the workforce and generally neglects managers. However, studies have shown that workload is a risk factor for managers. Therefore, the objectives of our study are to better understand the elements that make up a manager’s workload and the factors that influence it and identify the coping strategies used by managers to deal with their workloads.MethodsEmploying a qualitative approach, we analyzed semistructured interviews through an abductive method, utilizing diverse frameworks for data analysis. The participants came from the same Quebec healthcare establishment.ResultsOur findings align with the notion that workload is a multifaceted phenomenon that warrants a holistic analysis. The workload mapping framework we propose for healthcare network managers enables pinpointing those factors that contribute to the burden of their workload. Ultimately, this workload can detrimentally impact the psychological wellbeing of employees.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study takes a comprehensive look at workload by using a holistic approach, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. It also allows for the identification of coping strategies used by managers to deal with their workloads.

When acoustic challenges arise, linguistic context may help us fill in perceptual gaps. However, more knowledge is needed regarding how different types of background noise affect our ability to construct meaning from perceptually complex speech input. Additionally, there is limited evidence regarding whether perceptual complexity and linguistic complexity interact during processing of speech material that is longer and more complex than a single sentence. Our first research objective was to determine whether comprehension of spoken sentence pairs is impacted by the informational masking from a speech masker. Our second objective was to identify whether there is an interaction between perceptual and linguistic complexity during speech processing.MethodsWe used multiple measures including comprehension accuracy, reaction time, and processing effort , making comparisons across three different levels of linguistic complexity in two different noise conditions. Context conditions varied by final word, with each sentence pair ending with an expected exemplar , within-category violation , or between-category violation . Forty young adults with typical hearing performed a speech comprehension in noise task over three visits. Each participant heard sentence pairs presented in either multi-talker babble or spectrally shaped steady-state noise , with the same noise condition across all three visits.ResultsWe observed an effect of context but not noise on accuracy. Further, we observed an interaction of noise and context in peak pupil dilation data. Specifically, the context effect was modulated by noise type: context facilitated processing only in the more perceptually complex babble noise condition.DiscussionThese findings suggest that when perceptual complexity arises, listeners make use of the linguistic context to facilitate comprehension of speech obscured by background noise.

The dynamic development of self-regulation is an aspect of resilience that has received increased attention as a key mechanism predicting a variety of important short- and long-term outcomes. The current study examined how the self-regulation skills of infants and toddlers in a classroom could potentially shape classroom interactions and quality which, in turn, could potentially shape the development of self-regulation skills of the individual infants and toddlers enrolled in the classroom across an early childhood program year. The unique contribution of this study is the focus on a critical component of resilience, self-regulation, in an understudied age group, infants and toddlers, in an important and understudied context, the infant-toddler early childhood classroom.MethodsData are from a statewide evaluation of early childhood programs serving children birth to age growing up in low-income contexts. Multi-level mediation models were employed to examine the mediation effect of classroom quality between classroom-level self-regulation and individual children’s gain in self-regulation over a year.ResultsWe found a significant indirect path. The results showed that classroom-level self-regulation skills demonstrated by infants and toddlers in the fall predicted higher levels of teachers’ implementation of three important aspects of classroom quality – support for social-emotional, cognitive, and language development – in the winter. We also found that higher levels of teachers’ support for social-emotional, cognitive, and language development associated with children’s increased growth in self-regulation skills from fall to spring. The direct path from classroom-level self-regulation demonstrated in the fall to individual children’s gain in self-regulation was not significant.DiscussionThese findings, unique due to the focus on infants and toddlers in a classroom context, are discussed within the larger body of existing self-regulation research conducted with older children and prevalent theories outlining developmental mechanisms. Implications for both infant-toddler classroom practices and future research are addressed. Relative to practice, our findings have implications for informing how the development of self-regulation, an important component of resilience, can be supported in the youngest children, infants and toddlers, specifically those enrolled in center-based classrooms serving young children growing up in families with low incomes. We focus on the need to improve the support and professional development of infant-toddler teachers which, in turn, can improve classroom quality and foster resilience in infants and toddlers. Relative to research, our use of a relatively new measure of infant-toddler classroom quality, the Quality of Care for Infants and Toddlers , shows how this tool can expand infant-toddler research, a need in the current literature. Future research using different measures, designs, analytical strategies, and diverse samples and contexts is needed to further explain very young children’s development of self-regulation, a critical component of resilience."

Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsFour themes were developed: “I did not realize my friend was on the road to self-harm”: Friends' reactions to self-harm; “That's what friends do”: the role of friends; The impact of supporting a friend who self-harms; and “They were quite formative years”: reflecting on growth through the experience.DiscussionThe present findings highlight the complex experiences of young people supporting a friend who self-harms. Despite being willing to take on the role of a supporter, participants experienced a range of difficult emotions and consequences. The temporal transition running through the four themes reflects the evolving nature of participants' attitudes, knowledge, and friendships. Overall, results highlight the unmet needs of adolescents supporting young people who self-harm, as well as identifying potential pathways to “support the supporters” toward resilience."

Prior research has underscored the significance of contextual clues in vocabulary acquisition. However, few studies have compared the context provided by instructional materials and that generated by learners themselves. Hence, this present study sought to explore the impact of internal-generated contextual clues in comparison to those provided by instructional materials on EFL learners’ online vocabulary acquisition. A total of university students were enrolled and underwent electroencephalography . Based on a within-subjects design, all participants learned two groups of vocabulary words through a series of video clips under two conditions: one where the contexts were externally provided and the other where participants themselves generated the contexts. In this regard, participants were tasked with either viewing contextual clues presented on the screen or creating their own contextual clues for word comprehension. EEG signals were recorded during the learning process to explore neural activities, and post-tests were conducted to assess learning performance after each vocabulary learning session. Our behavioral results indicated that comprehending words with internal-generated contextual clues resulted in superior learning performance compared to using context provided by instructional materials. Furthermore, EEG data revealed that learners expended greater cognitive resources and mental effort in semantically integrating the meaning of words when they self-created contextual clues, as evidenced by stronger alpha and beta-band oscillations. Moreover, the stronger alpha-band oscillations and lower inter-subject correlation among learners suggested that the generative task of creating context enhanced their top-down attentional control mechanisms and selective visual processing when learning vocabulary from videos. These findings underscored the positive effects of internal-generated contextual clues, indicating that instructors should encourage learners to construct their own contexts in online EFL vocabulary instruction rather than providing pre-defined contexts. Future research should aim to explore the limits and conditions of employing these two types of contextual clues in online EFL vocabulary learning. This could be achieved by manipulating the quality and understandability of contexts and considering learners’ language proficiency levels."

This study delves into selecting brand endorsers across diverse cultural regions for the same brand.MethodsDrawing on the principles of self-consistency theory and self-construal theory, our research, conducted through three distinct experiments, reveals that consumers tend to hold more favorable opinions about brands endorsed by a single individual. Furthermore, self-consistency emerges as a crucial mediating factor in this phenomenon. Additionally, self-construal is an essential factor among consumers from various cultural backgrounds.ResultsConsumers with an independent self-construal exhibit more favorable brand perceptions when it comes to single-endorser brands compared to their counterparts with an interdependent self-construal. Conversely, individuals with an interdependent self-construal demonstrate a more positive disposition towards brands with multiple endorsers than those with an independent self-construal.DiscussionThis research not only enriches and extends our theoretical understanding of the impact of the number of brand endorsers on consumer brand attitudes but also provides valuable practical insights for optimizing the selection of brand endorsers for companies."

While some evidence exists regarding PsyCap’s trickle-down effect, the specific circumstances triggering this phenomenon remain unclear. This study investigates the relationship between followers’ and leaders’ PsyCap, employing the Social Cognitive Theory and considering the moderating effects of leaders’ age and POJ. The study focused on leader-follower dyads within a randomly selected sample of businesses, encompassing respondents. The survey investigation utilized the CAPI approach. The hypothesized model underwent testing through multilevel dyadic regression analysis, employing an actor-partner interdependence model. The findings support two moderators —employees’ POJ and managers’ age — and highlight the cross-over effect of PsyCap. Specifically, a stronger trickle-down link is observed when a leader is older and operating within a low POJ environment. Additionally, the study revealed a positive correlation between employees’ PsyCap and POJ. The development of POJ enhances employees’ PsyCap and resilience, while leaders’ PsyCap may compensate for organizational POJ deficiencies.

This feedback can elicit various emotional responses, which, in turn, influence learning. Most recent studies capture these emotions by single data streams, contradicting the multi-componential nature of emotion. Therefore, this study investigated university students solving mathematical problems using an adaptive learning technology. Students received immediate feedback on every step in the solution process, after which their physiological, experiential and behavioral responses to this feedback were recorded. Physiological arousal was measured by electrodermal activity, valence was measured by self-reports , and emotion types were measured by observations of facial expressions . Results showed more peaks in electrodermal activity after feedback than was expected based on chance. These responses were comparable in strength after feedback on failure and success. Students’ experiential responses conveyed mostly positive valence after feedback on success and mostly negative valence after feedback on failure. Behavioral observations showed more negative than positive emotion types after feedback on failure and more positive than negative emotion types after feedback on success. These results show that physiological arousal is a valuable objective indicator of emotional responses after immediate feedback but should be accompanied by other data streams in order to understand students’ emotional responses. Both valence and emotion types can be used for this purpose. These outcomes pave the way for designing adaptive learning technologies that take students’ emotions into account."

Children diagnosed with POMS often display various deficiencies across psychological, cognitive, sensory, and physical areas. As such, POMS poses significant challenges for parents’ well-being, with heightened emotional, financial, and physical strains linked to both the immediate and long-term care requirements of their children. In this preliminary study, we examined changes over three time-points in two measures of well-being: satisfaction with life and psychological distress. In addition, the role of perceived social support and coping flexibility was examined through a multilevel causal mediation model which suggested that PSS month post-diagnosis would predict coping flexibility at months post-diagnosis, which in turn would predict parents’ life satisfaction and psychological distress at months post-diagnosis.MethodsThe research was conducted at a tertiary university-affiliated children’s hospital in central Israel. Preliminary data were obtained from parents at three times-points. Participants provided demographic information and filled out the following standardized self-report questionnaires: the Diener’s Satisfaction with Life Scale, Kessler’s inventory for measuring psychological distress , the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support , and the Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma Scale for measuring coping flexibility.ResultsOver time , parents reported stable levels of PSS, coping flexibility, satisfaction with life, and psychological distress. In addition, mothers reported significantly greater PSS from friends than did fathers. Regarding the causal mediation model, greater PSS from friends at T was significantly associated with an increase in coping flexibility from T to T.

Our findings revealed that authentic leadership is positively associated with the development of affective commitment, with distributive justice acting as a mediating factor between the two. Furthermore, interactional justice negatively moderates the relationship between distributive justice and affective commitment. Contrary to initial expectations, the second moderation, between authentic leadership and affective commitment, was not found to be significant. The research concludes by discussing the practical implications of the results."

Among the participants, women constituted .%, while men accounted for .% . To explore the influence of sociodemographic characteristics on specific CAAS item responses, a Multiple-Indicators, Multiple-Causes model with Differential Item Functioning was employed.ResultsThe findings revealed robust internal consistency and reliability in the CAAS. Both the four-factor and second-order factor models exhibited excellent fit indices, emphasizing the significance of each item within the measure. Sociodemographic characteristics did not demonstrate a significant direct effect on the four CAAS subscales, it is worth noting the exception regarding paternal education. Paternal education was found to have a statistical significance impact on two specific CAAS items: “looking for opportunities to grow as a person” and “becoming curious about new opportunities.”ConclusionThese findings underscore the intricate influence of paternal education on specific aspects of career adaptability, suggesting that certain dimensions of career adaptability may be shaped by factors extending beyond the conventional sociodemographic variables examined in this study. Future research could delve deeper into the complex interplay of sociodemographic factors and individual attributes to provide a more holistic perspective on career adaptability in Thailand."

Compared with explicit absence, nurses’ presenteeism has a more lasting impact and significant harm and loss. It has become an essential factor affecting nurses’ physical and mental health, declining quality of healthcare services, and elevated healthcare-related risks. There is a lack of research exploring whether occupational coping self-efficacy influences nurses’ presenteeism behavior, especially in less-developed regions of China.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the current status of ICU nurses’ occupational coping self-efficacy and presenteeism in public hospitals in western China and to explore the impact of ICU nurses’ occupational coping self-efficacy on presenteeism.MethodsA cross-sectional research design selected ICU nurses in western China from January to February as survey respondents. A general information questionnaire, Occupational Coping Self-Efficacy Scale , and Stanford Presenteeism Scale were used. SPSS . software was used for statistical analysis. Pearson correlation analysis and multivariate hierarchical regression were used to explore the influence of ICU nurses’ occupational coping self-efficacy on presenteeism.ResultsA total of ICU nurses completed the questionnaire. The OCSE-N score of ICU nurses was , and the SPS- score was . The high presenteeism was .%. Correlation analysis showed that in ICU nurses, OCSE-N total score was negatively correlated with SPS- total score , indicating that the higher the level of occupational coping self-efficacy, the lower the presenteeism. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis showed that occupational coping self-efficacy strongly predicted presenteeism, accounting for approximately .% of the total variance.ConclusionThere is a correlation between ICU nurses’ occupational coping self-efficacy and presenteeism, and nurses’ occupational coping self-efficacy affects presenteeism differently. Managers should pay attention to nurses’ occupational coping self-efficacy to promote nurses’ presenteeism reduction."

While craftsmanship can be shaped by both contextual factors and personal traits, existing research has dominantly focused on the former, leaving the latter less examined. Such a lack of examination limits our understanding of craftsmanship in workplace.ObjectiveFollowing the view that individuals’ intrinsic desire to do the job as the core of craftsmanship, we define craftsmanship spirit as an individual’s psychological state of feeling competent, transcendent, and valuable during work, which evolves as an individual’s skills and knowledge expand. We then draw on the classic dispositional literature to explore how individuals’ personality traits shape the development of CS differently , and test our theory using a latent growth modeling approach.MethodsWe conducted a four-round on-site questionnaire survey with participants who were employees at a large manufacturing company in China. The final sample consists of matched respondents. Data analysis was performed in Mplus ..ResultsEmpirical results confirm our hypotheses that both conscientiousness and openness to experience have a positive effect on the initial level of CS. Besides, conscientiousness has a negative effect on the subsequent growth of CS. However, the proposed negative effect of openness to experience on the subsequent growth of CS was not supported when the other four personality traits were considered simultaneously.ConclusionThis study reveals that conscientiousness and openness to experience have an important effect on CS. Specifically, both conscientiousness and openness to experience are associated with a high level of CS, and the former is associated with low growth of CS. This study not only broadened our understanding on the antecedents of CS, but also provided a dynamic perspective to understand CS in workplace."

Using Qualtrics, participants answered a series of self-reported questionnaires and completed several neurocognitive tasks. Three independent multiple linear regression models were conducted to assess whether impulsivity, risk seeking, affective state, and trauma history predict depersonalization, trauma symptoms, and PTSD symptoms.ResultsAs hypothesized, we found that depersonalization and other trauma symptoms are associated with heightened impulsivity, increased risk-seeking, impaired affective states, and a history of traumatic experiences.ConclusionWe demonstrate that an imbalanced CNDS , as evidenced by decreased future valuation, increased risk seeking, and impaired affective states, predicts heightened depersonalization and other trauma and PTSD symptomatology. This is the first time that dissociation has been connected to delay discounting . Interventions that positively impact areas of the CNDS, such as episodic future thinking or mindfulness meditation, may be a target to help decrease dissociative symptoms."

The types are Extroverted Sensing, Extroverted Intuition, Extroverted Feeling, Extroverted Thinking, Introverted Sensing, Introverted Intuition, Introverted Feeling, and Introverted Thinking. A nationwide online survey was conducted in South Korea. We performed multidimensional scaling and classification analyses based on Korean adult profiles with eight psychological types to test the bipolarity assumption. The results showed that the Procrustes-rotated four-dimensional space successfully represented four types of opposing tendencies. Moreover, the bipolarity assumption in the four dimensions of Jungian typology was tested and compared between lower and higher psychological distress populations via cluster analysis. Lastly, we explored patterns of responses in lower and higher psychological distress populations using intersubject correlation. Both similarity analyses and classification results consistently support the theoretical considerations on the conceptualization of Jung’s type in independent order that the types could be derived without bipolar assumption as Singer and Loomis expected in their Type Development Inventory.

This is particularly difficult for young children, who mainly rely on environmental cues to get there. Research suggests that training children to look for the most relevant perceptual cues is promising. Furthermore, as transferring skills to a new task is difficult, the question of whether young children are able to transfer such training remains open. The aim of this study was to test the extent to which two strategies of goal self-cueing—labeling and pointing—can help -year-old children to identify the relevant cues to clearly identify the goal of the task. The effects of explicit strategy training were tested in a near transfer task.MethodNinety-nine typically developing year olds took part in the study. They were divided into three groups: two were trained collectively in one of the two strategies and the third group as a control group with no strategy training. All children performed a cued card-sorting task four times: Pre-test, Collective training, Post-test, and Transfer with new cards.ResultsResults confirmed the beneficial effect of strategy training on goal identification, particularly after training . In the transfer phase, all three groups performed equally well.DiscussionThis study contributes to our understanding of how young children seek information when they look for the most relevant cues for identifying the goal of a task, and the benefits they may derive in a transfer task.

However, cultural differences may contribute to parents’ different values that ultimately influence their behaviors and attitudes. This cross-cultural study aimed to compare the value parents have on their children’s private music education by examining four cases in Guilin, Guangxi and Tampa, Florida . Two main research questions guided this study: How do parents in Guilin and Tampa perceive and value their children’s music learning? Does the value parents hold for their children’s extracurricular music activities differ across different cultural contexts? If so, how do parents’ values and perceptions of their children’s involvement in extracurricular music activities differ between the contexts of Guilin and Tampa? We purposefully selected participants from two regions based on these criteria: the participants included a single-child family and a two-child family in each of the two regions; children’s age ranged from to years and lived with their biological parents children were currently taking music lessons after school. We interviewed both children and parents during the data collection. The key findings reveal that parental values transcend two cultural contexts, specifically in motivations for music learning, expectations of music learning, utilizing personal background, and strategies for success. The findings suggest that several factors, such as children’s autonomy, musical joy, pursuit of musical career, “beauty development” and achievements, may have contributed to parents’ values. The implication for parents, psychologists, and policymakers is to understand the diverse needs and values within different cultural backgrounds, to promote the children’s development, to design curricula, and to use effective teaching methods in music education. In conclusion, both Guilin’s and Tampa’s parents’ values varied due to cultural differences, which further influenced their behaviors, attitudes and perceptions toward their children’s musical experiences."

Positive maternal parenting reduced burnout by increasing self-compassion and consequently teacher efficacy. Teachers’ self-compassion was more closely related to burnout than teacher efficacy, which was treated as an important variable in relation to teachers.

It addresses the lack of clear legislation on euthanasia and doctor-assisted killing, the impact of cultural and philosophical beliefs, and the evolution of legal and ethical perspectives on suicide. Additionally, it examines the psychological aspects of suicide ideation in acutely-ill patients, focusing on factors like familial burden and loss of dignity.MethodA survey was conducted with Chinese adults, aged to years, using popular social media platforms in China. The study aimed to reflect a broad spectrum of the adult population in terms of age, education, and professional sectors. The research model involves suicide rumination as an independent variable, acutely-ill patients' suicide acceptance as a dependent variable, and three mediators: cognitive depression, ethical suicide acceptance, and suicide legitimization.ResultsThe findings reveal a significant total effect of Suicide Rumination on Acutely-ill Patients' Suicide Acceptance, underlining a robust direct relationship that supports Hypothesis . The analysis indicates that Suicide Rumination is a significant predictor of Cognitive depression, explaining approximately .% of its variance, thereby fully supporting Hypothesis a. However, the effect of Suicide Rumination on Ethical Suicide Acceptance did not emerge as significant, failing to support Hypothesis b, while its impact on Suicide Legitimization was also non-significant, not supporting Hypothesis c. Cognitive depression was found to have a substantial effect in the models for both Ethical Suicide Acceptance and Suicide Legitimization, supporting Hypotheses a and b. In the comprehensive model assessing Acutely-ill Patients' Suicide Acceptance, incorporating all mediators, a significant variance was explained. Notably, Suicide Rumination, Ethical Suicide Acceptance, and Suicide Legitimization all emerged as significant predictors of this acceptance, with varying effects, thus supporting Hypotheses a and b. The role of Cognitive depression in this model was marginally significant, offering limited support for Hypothesis c. Crucially, the indirect effects of Suicide Rumination on Acutely-ill Patients' Suicide Acceptance through different mediational paths varied in significance and impact. The indirect effect via Cognitive depression alone, and through the sequential combination of Cognitive depression and Ethical Suicide Acceptance, were significant, highlighting the nuanced role of these mediators. These findings underscore the importance of considering multiple pathways in understanding the dynamics of Suicide Rumination and its influence on the acceptance of suicide among acutely-ill patients.ConclusionThis paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the legal, cultural, ethical, and psychological dimensions of euthanasia, doctor-assisted killing, and suicide in China.

The dot comparison task, in which the more numerous of two dot arrays must be selected, is a dominant method to investigate this phenomenon. It has been shown that the visual properties of the two dot patterns strongly influence the comparison. This influence can be systematically investigated by manipulating visual properties congruently and incongruently with numerosity. However, it remains unclear how learning and prior experience affect the influence of the visual properties. To address this question, we introduced feedback into the classical dot comparison task: during the learning phase, participants in the experimental group received feedback after each trial indicating whether their answer was correct whereas participants in the control group did not. After the learning phase, neither group received feedback. The convex hull of the dot patterns and the average dot diameter were manipulated congruently and incongruently with numerosity. Our results show that feedback had no effect on overall performance. However, when manipulated separately, dot diameter no longer affected performance in the experimental group after the learning phase, but it did in the control group. Moreover, this effect remained visible even when diameter and convex hull were manipulated simultaneously. This pattern of results is consistent with the notion of sensory integration which proposes that weights are assigned to different visual cues and that numerical judgments depend on an additive combination of these weights. We also found a correlation between performance on an arithmetic task and performance on trials in which dot size was manipulated incongruently with numerosity. However, there were no correlations between an inhibition task and performance in the dot comparison task. Taken together, the current results suggest that learning with feedback may affect some visual properties but not others. Future studies should further investigate a wider range of visual properties to examine which of them can be influenced by learning and under what conditions learning occurs."

Extrinsic sources of motivation were identified as the positive attitudes and behaviors of individuals in their environment, often related to admiration, appreciation, and being set as an example, and this situation has a positive impact on wheelchair basketball athletes. On the other hand, it can be stated that intrinsic motivations such as identity change, gaining self-confidence, and the feeling of success are crucial in overcoming constraints through sports participation."

A sample of in-service subject teachers who taught in lower secondary schools in Estonia were included in the study. Data was collected with a GPK test and self-reported questionnaires on instructional quality and commitments to teaching in the context of an OECD Teacher Knowledge Survey. Based on the cluster analysis, three groups of in-service teachers were identified: “the over-confident” teachers with average self-efficacy and very low GPK, “the competent” teachers with high self-efficacy and GPK, and “the insecure” teachers with low self-efficacy and average GPK. These three types of teachers were different in terms of instructional quality and commitments to teaching. It seemed that teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs are more important than GPK for instructional quality; however, GPK is more important for teachers’ professional persistence illuminating their general sense of professional identity. Implications of these findings for teacher education and teacher retention will be discussed."

As global interconnectivity intensifies, the increasing number of Chinese students seeking education abroad presents a unique opportunity to examine the psychological and sociocultural dynamics of this demographic.AimCentral to our investigation is the role of Cultural Intelligence, a crucial competency for navigating diverse environments, and Intrapreneurial Self Capital, a composite of psychological resources instrumental in educational and career success. The study also explores the mediating role of Cultural Intelligence in the relationship between Intrapreneurial Self Capital and student flourishing, and examines how gender moderates this dynamic.MethodThe research engaged Chinese international students, utilizing a variety of social networks for participant recruitment. The survey, conducted via Qualtrics, focused on a diverse range of students across different educational levels and disciplines. A moderated mediation model was tested to examine the mediation effect of cultural intelligence on the relationship between intrapreneurial self-capital and flourishing, with gender serving as a moderating variable.ResultsOur findings reveal significant insights into how Intrapreneurial Self Capital and Cultural Intelligence contribute to the personal and professional development of Chinese international students. Overall, the results suggest that the impact of Intrapreneurial Self Capital on various cognitive qualities is moderated by gender, highlighting the importance of considering gender differences in this context. Related to the prediction of Flourishing, the direct effect of Intrapreneurial Self Capital on flourishing is notably strong. However, the mediating roles of Metacognitive, Cognitive, and Behavioral aspects of Cultural Intelligence show different levels of influence.ImplicationsThe study underscores the need for educational institutions to adopt holistic approaches in fostering student well-being and success, accounting for the nuanced effects of cultural and gender dynamics. These results have significant implications for the development of targeted educational programs and training, aimed at enhancing the international educational experience for students and professionals."

Nevertheless, significant scientific inquiries, such as the uniformity of the rejuvenating effect across distinct categories of natural landscapes on college students and the choice of the optimal plant community for achieving the most potent restorative effect, remain unexplored. This study aimed to address these questions by selecting four plant communities and using an electroencephalography method to capture the neuroelectric activity of the participants in combination with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule score to explore the effects of plant community types on emotional recovery. The results showed that all four plant communities significantly increased positive emotions and significantly reduced negative emotions. There was no significant difference in the recovery effect of positive emotions among the four plant community types, but there was a significant difference in the recovery effect of negative emotions. The effect of tree-shrub-grass composite woodland on the negative emotion recovery effect is the best; the EEG results found that the alpha wave amplitude induced by the tree-shrub-grass composite woodland was significantly higher than that of the other three groups of plant communities, and the EEG and behavioral results were consistent. The results show that the tree-shrub-grass composite woodland has the best restoration effect and has stronger planning and design significance."

Here we present a new, fully immersive virtual reality task battery with integrated eye tracking for mild visual USN and extinction assessment in the acute state of stroke to overthrow these limitations.MethodsWe included right-sided stroke patients and healthy controls aged − years. Three VR tasks named the Extinction, the Storage and the Shoot the target tasks were developed to assess USN. Furthermore, neuropsychological assessment examining various parts of cognitive functioning was conducted to measure general abilities. We compared VR and neuropsychological task performance in stroke patients – those with and without USN – to healthy controls and tentatively reported the usability of VR system in the acute state of stroke.ResultsPatients had mostly mild neurological and USN symptoms. Nonetheless, we found several differences between the USN+ and healthy control groups in VR task performance. Compared to controls, USN+ patients showed visual extinction and asymmetry in gaze behavior and detection times in distinct spatial locations. Extinction was most evident in the extrapersonal space and delayed detection times on the extreme left and on the left upper parts. Also, USN+ patients needed more time to complete TMT A compared with USN− patients and TMT B compared with controls. VR system usability and acceptance were rated high; no relevant adverse effects occurred.ConclusionNew VR technology with eye tracking enables ecologically valid and objective assessment methods with various exact measures for mild USN and thus could potentially improve future clinical assessments."

The odds of completing a degree are decreased if a student has a low socio-economic status , is the first in a family to attend college , attends multiple institutions, stops out multiple times, reduces credit loads over time, performs poorly in major-specific coursework, has competing family obligations, and experiences financial difficulties. Stopping out of college does not always indicate that a student is no longer interested in pursuing an education; it can be an indication of a barrier, or several barriers faced. Institutions can benefit themselves and students by utilizing person-centered statistical methods to re-engage students they have lost, particularly those near the end of their degree plan. Using demographic, academic, and financial variables, this study applied latent class analysis to explore subgroups of seniors who have stopped out of a public four-year Tier One Research intuition before graduating with a four-year degree.

The detection of such memories plays a key role in criminal trials. Among behavioral memory-detection methods, the autobiographical Implicit Association Test has gained popularity for its flexibility and suitability for forensic applications. The aIAT is a reaction time-based methodology aiming to assess whether information about an event is encoded in the respondent’s mind. Here, we introduced the eye-D index, a measure based on the topography of fixations while performing the aIAT, as an additional measure to detect autobiographical memories covertly.MethodsIn this study, participants were involved in a mock-crime experiment in which they could act as Guilty or Innocent. One week later all participants underwent the aIAT combined with eye-tracking to investigate the presence of the crime-related memory.ResultsGuilty participants showed a higher number of fixations towards the category labels in the block in which true sentences shared the same response key with crime-related sentences, as compared to the block in which true sentences were paired with sentences describing an alternative version. Innocent participants showed the opposite pattern. This unbalanced allocation of attention to the category labels was quantified by the eye-D index and was found to be highly correlated to the standard aIAT-D index.DiscussionThis suggests that more fixations to the category labels could indicate increased cognitive load and monitoring of response conflicts. These preliminary results highlight eye-tracking as a tool to detect autobiographical memories covertly while performing the aIAT."

Thirty-one migrant children, nine parents, teachers and a school principal from a Shanghai junior high school participated in this research. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Results and DiscussionThe findings indicated that although video-recorded lessons were high quality, it put pressure on migrant children due to the lessons containing only new material with no reviews and reduced opportunities for them to interact with their own teachers. In addition, the differences in study progress between the migrant children and the local children that showed up during the online learning, and neglect from teachers and policymakers, made the migrant children anxious, angry and confused about their future. Besides, parents install monitors at home to support their children’s online learning, but it had the opposite effect and simply provoked increased conflicts between children and their parents. Finally, although the online lessons have affected the optical health of students, the subsequent additional cooking lessons have mitigated the optical health problem and strengthened the connections between home and school.ConclusionThe inequalities of education encountered by migrant children during the COVID- period have made them realize the disparities they have suffered in Shanghai.

The aim of current study was to introduce a new method to examine winning patterns emerging from Qatar through a configurational lens. To this end, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis was conducted using samples out of Qatar matches discriminating winning and losing teams in regular time and in min of extra time . Then, we selected seven variables as our causal conditions, namely, shots on target, possession, defensive line breaks, crosses, receptions in the final third, forced turnovers, and direct pressures. Necessity analysis and sufficiency analysis of configurations were conducted according to fsQCA requirements. The fsQCA operation showed that no individual causal condition is necessary to winning a game and four configurations were derived from the QCA results and these combinations of conditions fall into three typologies of play style: a possession play style, direct play style, and all-round play style. The results confirmed the fact that football is a complex system and suggested that a winning outcome is often produced by combinations of multiple factors.

Brain electrical activity was recorded in university students as they were handwriting visually presented words using a digital pen and typewriting the words on a keyboard. Connectivity analyses were performed on EEG data recorded with a -channel sensor array. When writing by hand, brain connectivity patterns were far more elaborate than when typewriting on a keyboard, as shown by widespread theta/alpha connectivity coherence patterns between network hubs and nodes in parietal and central brain regions. Existing literature indicates that connectivity patterns in these brain areas and at such frequencies are crucial for memory formation and for encoding new information and, therefore, are beneficial for learning. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal pattern from visual and proprioceptive information obtained through the precisely controlled hand movements when using a pen, contribute extensively to the brain’s connectivity patterns that promote learning. We urge that children, from an early age, must be exposed to handwriting activities in school to establish the neuronal connectivity patterns that provide the brain with optimal conditions for learning. Although it is vital to maintain handwriting practice at school, it is also important to keep up with continuously developing technological advances. Therefore, both teachers and students should be aware of which practice has the best learning effect in what context, for example when taking lecture notes or when writing an essay."

Across two studies we investigate the complex relationship between executive functions and emotional downregulation through two complementary research designs. The focus lies on key components of EFs—working memory, inhibitory control, and switching—and their relationship with effective emotional regulation. Surprisingly, switching emerged as the sole significant predictor in two multiple linear regression models, challenging the conventional belief that all major EFs broadly contribute to emotional downregulation. The first study, involving Ecuadorian adults between and years old, used experimental tasks to assess the association between EFs and emotional regulation, aligning with existing literature that posits a link between EFs and emotional control. The second study, involving Ecuadorian adults between and years old, added depth by incorporating self-report measures, providing a broader, ecologically valid perspective. However, these measures did not significantly predict downregulation, highlighting a gap between self-perception and actual cognitive abilities. Additionally, demographic predictors varied between the two studies, urging future research to consider methodological design and task selection carefully. The study also raises questions about the validity of commonly used measures, emphasising the need for more nuanced tools to capture the complexity of EFs and emotional regulation. Our findings suggest a targeted research avenue focusing on EFs for both future research and clinical interventions. Attention is called to the methodological decisions that can influence the observed associations, and the need for broader demographic representation in future studies."

Motivation is posited to have a greater influence on listening effort under high, compared to low, listening demands.MethodsTo test this prediction, we manipulated the listening demands of a speech recognition task using tone vocoders to create moderate and high listening demand conditions. We manipulated motivation using evaluative threat, i.e., informing participants that they must reach a particular “score” for their results to be usable. Resource availability was assessed by means of working memory span and included as a fixed effects predictor. Outcome measures were indices of LE, including reaction times , self-rated work and self-rated tiredness, in addition to task performance . Given the recent popularity of online studies, we also wanted to examine the effect of experimental context on the efficacy of manipulations of listening demands and motivation. We carried out two highly similar experiments with two groups of young adults, a laboratory experiment and an online experiment. To make listening demands comparable between the two studies, vocoder settings had to differ. All results were analysed using linear mixed models.ResultsResults showed that under laboratory conditions, listening demands affected all outcomes, with significantly lower correct response rates, slower RTs and greater self-rated work with higher listening demands. In the online study, listening demands only affected RTs. In addition, motivation affected self-rated work. Resource availability was only a significant predictor for RTs in the online study.DiscussionThese results show that the influence of motivation and listening demands on LE depends on the type of outcome measures used and the experimental context. It may also depend on the exact vocoder settings.

In the domain of youth sport development, one significant factor that must be considered is the perceived competence of players. This variable is closely linked to positive psychological outcomes and sustained practice. However, there is a lack of understanding about how other important developmental factors such as age, early sport specialization, players’ position and relative age affect players’ perceived competence. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the relationships between these developmental factors, perceived ice hockey competence and a global measure of perceived sport competence.MethodsData was drawn from players , who completed on-line questionnaires, from which we conducted path analyses involving all variables.ResultsYounger players tend to display higher perceived competence scores than older players. Additionally, players who opted to specialize earlier also reported higher perceived competence. Furthermore, forwards and defensemen had differing perceptions of their competence, which was in line with their respective roles on the ice. The study also showed relative age effects, in which players who were born earlier relative to the selection period tend to perceive themselves more advantageously in three components of perceived competence.DiscussionBased on these findings, several recommendations are proposed for coaches and decision-makers to encourage the positive development of ice hockey players.

Seven case study companies are examined based on interviews with three executives from each firm, including the CEO. All seven companies are privately owned small/medium sized businesses from a cross section of industries and diverse geographic bases, ranging from Michigan to the Pacific Northwest, to Singapore, Egypt, and Florida. Four of the companies are considered “positive impact companies” based on their organizational affiliations, while the other three are considered traditional entrepreneurial companies . The overall findings suggest that the core of positive impact leadership resides in a shift in the mindset of leaders toward one of connectedness and purpose, and that these factors influence the quality of relationships in organizations in a positive way whether the company is considered a PIC or a TEC. The results also suggest a close relationship between several core indicators of a fundamental shift in understanding about the role of business in society: shared values of human wellbeing, a common shared vision, an emphasis on collaboration and caring in organizations, and a long-term perspective toward the creation of shared economic prosperity."

Understanding the effect of this content on people’s behavior is essential to gain insight into problematic gaming habits. However, this issue is yet to be studied extensively. In this study, we examined how gaming-related content on social media affects young adults explicitly and implicitly. We studied healthy young adults who played online games casually and asked them to report their gaming desire. We also conducted an implicit association test to measure their implicit attitudes toward gaming-related content. We also investigated the relationship between these measures and various psychological factors, such as personality traits, self-efficacy, impulsiveness, and cognitive flexibility. The results revealed that participants had a higher explicit gaming desire when exposed to gaming-related cues on social media than neutral cues. They also had a robust positive implicit attitude toward gaming-related content on social media. Explicit gaming desire was positively correlated with neuroticism levels. Furthermore, the IAT effect was negatively correlated with self-efficacy and cognitive flexibility levels. However, there were no significant correlations between explicit gaming desire/IAT effect and impulsiveness levels.

We assumed that the Aha! experience arises from a shift in processing fluency triggered by changing from an initially incoherent problem representation to a coherent one, which ultimately leads to the retrieval of a solution with unexpected ease and speed. First, we hypothesized that higher Aha! experience ratings would indicate more sudden solutions, manifesting in a reduced correlation between the initial difficulty ratings and solution times. Second, we hypothesized that higher Aha! experience ratings would correspond to a greater shift in the subjective difficulty ratings between the initial and retrospective assessments. To test our hypotheses, we developed a novel set of rebus puzzles. A total of participants solved rebuses and provided initial and retrospective difficulty ratings . They also rated their Aha! experience , confidence in solutions, and the likability of each rebus. Our findings revealed that the initial ratings of the problem’s subjective difficulty were positively correlated with the solution time and that this correlation decreased in the case of a stronger Aha! experience. Aha! experience ratings were positively correlated with the differences between initial and retrospective difficulty ratings, confidence, solution accuracy, and rebus likability. We interpreted our results to be in line with the processing fluency and metacognitive prediction error accounts."

We investigated how achievement emotions moderate the direct and indirect associations between mastery and performance goal orientation and academic achievement. Also, we used as mediators the motivational components from Pintrich and De Groot’s theoretical framework of motivation and learning strategies. Romanian university students participated in the study. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that self-efficacy was the only significant mediator, and this relationship was moderated by hope, pride and hopelessness. In addition, the links between mastery and performance approach goals and motivational components are stronger when the positive emotions are higher and the negative ones are lower. Mastery avoidance goals were linked with high scores of motivational components at higher levels of negative and lower levels of positive achievement emotions, whereas the association of avoidance goals with motivational components was moderated by two positive emotions . The patterns derived from the moderating role of achievement emotions in the relationships between goal orientation, motivational components and academic achievement, alongside several inconsistent results and implications in theory and education, are discussed."

While the assessment of suggestibility relies on standardized questionnaire, no such an instrument exists to reliably assess autobiographical skills in children. This aspect is further important when considering that the development of such skills seems to be related to the suggestibility, that is, suggestibility would be reduced in presence of higher autobiographical skills. However, no direct test of this relationship is available in literature, also due to the lack of quantitative instruments for assessing autobiographical skills.MethodsTo fulfill both these methodological and theoretical issues, in this study a new tool was validated to measure the main autobiographical narrative skills in relation to both Retrospective Memory and Prospective Memory: the Children Recalling Autobiographical Memory . We recruited a sample of children aged – years.Results and discussionThe result of the EFA analysis showed one-factor model, and revealed also good fit indexes and internal reliability. After validating this new tool, we further used it to test our main hypothesis, that is, children with higher autobiographical memory skills were less vulnerable to interrogative suggestibility as assessed by Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale .

Our main objective was to tease apart variance in symptom severity that was uniquely attributable to four associated variables that are frequently confounded: exposure to childhood emotional abuse, alexithymia, sensory processing sensitivity , and anxiety sensitivity .MethodsUniversity students completed an online survey designed to measure our four key study variables along with several other potentially relevant variables including sex, physical activity levels, and perceived COVID- impacts.ResultsOver half of the participants reported moderate to extremely severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. Females reported stronger signs of SPS and AS and were more likely than males to have increased their moderate/vigorous exercise since the pandemic began. After controlling for the other variables, the best predictors of perceived COVID- impacts were SPS, childhood emotional abuse, and current levels of physical activity. Whereas all three personality variables and childhood emotional abuse emerged as significant predictors of both depression and anxiety, neither COVID- impacts nor physical activity levels accounted for unique variance in either model. Unexpectedly, male sex emerged as an additional risk factor for depression, raising the possibility that males experience unique stressors and societal pressures that increase their risk of depression.DiscussionThese findings help to clarify the links between childhood emotional abuse, personality traits implicated in emotional awareness and self-regulation, and mental health.

It employs hierarchical linear modeling to analyse a sample of followers to middle-level managers in Russian organizations. The analysis finds only transformational leadership to be generally negatively associated with emotional exhaustion. However, under conditions of high individual-level power distance orientation among followers, this association diminishes whereas that of authoritarian leadership and exhaustion increases. Benevolent paternalistic leadership is unrelated to emotional exhaustion. The study extends research on the relative importance of Western and non-Western leadership behaviors for employee wellbeing in high-power distance contexts and on how this importance differs across followers, thus highlighting the role of follower expectations in determining the effectiveness of leadership.

Emerging evidence focuses on whether cli-fi stories affect people’s self-reported emotions, attitudes, and intentions. Few studies, however, examine the effect of such stories on revealed behavior, and whether the cli-fi story medium, i.e., whether stories are presented in text, audio, or audio-visual format, matters. We investigate the causal effect of cli-fi stories, and the medium through which they are communicated on self-reported support for climate policy, individual and collective action intentions, and a revealed measure of charitable donations. In a pre-registered online experiment , participants were randomly assigned to one of conditions – to read scientific information about climate change , read a story unrelated to the environment , read a cli-fi story in which a protagonist took intentional pro-environmental actions , listen to the same cli-fi story in audio format , or watch an animation of the cli-fi story . When comparing the fiction-text, fact-text, and control conditions, we found that cli-fi stories are not always more effective than alternative climate communications: participants in the fact-text condition reported higher support for climate policies, and intentions of taking individual environmental actions, and negative feelings of sadness, disappointment, and guilt, compared to the text-based control and cli-fi text condition. When comparing the cli-fi media format, we found that cli-fi videos were most effective in increasing pro-environmental charitable donations in an incentivized choice task, and self-reported feelings of happiness, hope, and inspiration. The findings show that scientific information about the climate and climate-fiction have an important place in the climate communications toolkit and can offer distinct pathways to enhance support for policy and behavioral change.

Past work has shown that older adults are less able to intentionally suppress information from memory relative to younger adults, which is often attributed to deficits in inhibitory abilities. Instructions in traditional Directed Forgetting tasks contain terms that may elicit stereotype threat in older adults, which may negatively impact memory. Here, we tested whether the instructions in a Directed Forgetting task affected older adults’ ability to appropriately control the contents of memory.MethodsIn two experiments that differed in the number of words presented , younger and older adults were randomized into one of four crossed Conditions of a Directed Forgetting task. At encoding, participants were either instructed to remember/ forget items, or to think about/not think about items. At test, they were either asked whether the memory probe was old or new, or whether they had seen it before . Each experiment contained data from younger and older adults, with ~ participants per Condition. All participants were recruited from Prolific and tested online.ResultsIn neither Experiment nor Experiment did we find evidence of a stereotype threat effect, or age-related effects of directed forgetting. We did find that performance for to-be-forgotten items was worse in conditions with encoding instructions that contained words that might trigger stereotype threat relative to conditions that did not contain such words: when explicitly told to forget items, both older and younger adults forgot more items than did participants who were cued to not think about the words and put them out of mind. However, we found no such difference across the two different remember instructions: regardless of whether participants were told to remember or to think about items, recognition memory for to be retained items was high.

High HPF consumption is also linked to mental health disorder symptoms. Mindfulness-based interventions are popular treatments for obesity and MHDs, but little is known about the relationship between trait mindfulness and motive-based HPF eating. Therefore, a total of young adults completed a survey that included the Palatable Eating Motives Scale- , the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and demographic and body mass index questions. An MHD questionnaire allowed a comparison of HPF eating between participants with and without various MHDs. Regressions revealed that Coping-eating was independently associated with lower mindfulness and also greater perceived stress, higher BMI, and female sex. Of these variables, only lower mindfulness was independently associated with Reward-, Social-, and Conformity-eating. Coping- and Reward-eating were more frequent in participants with versus without an anxiety disorder, depression, ADD/ADHD, and PTSD. Coping-eating was also more frequent in participants with body dysmorphic disorder. These findings warrant investigations in participants with clinically validated diagnoses for DSM-specific MHDs. Results from such investigations and the uncovered nature of associations between motive-specific HPF eating and trait mindfulness could provide novel targets to improve mindfulness-based interventions for obesity and MHDs."

The importance of employees’ counterproductive work behaviors in organizations is becoming increasingly obvious. This is directly related to the sustainable development and survival of organizations. This study believes that employee’s behavior is closely related to leadership style. In particular, employees’ in small- and medium-sized enterprises are often manipulated and deceived by leaders, resulting in dissatisfaction and counterproductive work behavior. In order to address this behavior, this study collected survey data from employees from Chinese SMEs to explore the relationship between perceived abusive supervision and organizational political behavior in Machiavellian leadership and counterproductive work behavior. The results suggest that Machiavellian positive influence counterproductive work behavior through a mediating role of perceived abusive supervision. Furthermore, leader organizational political behavior moderates the indirect effect of perceived abusive supervision such that the effect is stronger when leader organizational political behavior is high. This study aimed to identify the variables that increase employees counterproductive work behavior, propose recommendations for reducing employees’ counterproductive work behavior, expanded the scope of counterproductive work behavior research, and provided a theoretical basis for related studies."

Dutch-speaking adults and - and -year-old children were presented with a series of video clips in which an actor produced a Dutch action verb with or without an accompanying iconic gesture. Participants were then asked to repeat what they had heard. The speech signal was either clear or altered into - or -band noise-vocoded speech. Children had more difficulty than adults in disambiguating degraded speech in the speech-only condition. However, when presented with both speech and gestures, children reached a comparable level of accuracy to that of adults in the degraded-speech-only condition. Furthermore, for adults, the enhancement of gestures was greater in the -band condition than in the -band condition, whereas children showed the opposite pattern. Gestures help children to disambiguate degraded speech, but children need more phonological information than adults to benefit from use of gestures. Children’s multimodal language integration needs to further develop to adapt flexibly to challenging situations such as degraded speech, as tested in our study, or instances where speech is heard with environmental noise or through a face mask."

Prior work suggests two different possibilities regarding the role of attention to objects in infants’ formation of abstract categories of spatial relations: Attention to objects may compete with attention to the spatial relations between them, or assist with encoding of the spatial relation information. Using eye-tracking, we examined how infants’ visual attention to objects related to their successful formation of an abstract category of support relations .MethodsThirty-eight -month-old infants’ eye movements were recorded during a support categorization task, where infants were habituated to four dynamic events depicting support relations and then presented with test events that depicted either a support or containment relation with objects that they had seen or not seen in the habituation phase. Based on their looking time to the familiar versus novel spatial relation in the test, infants were classified into two groups: categorizers, who formed an abstract category of a support relation, and non-categorizers, who did not do so.ResultsDuring their initial phase of learning , categorizers paid greater attention to the object moved by a hand in comparison to non-categorizers, whereas their attention to the static object or their gaze shifts between the two objects did not differ. In addition, when presented with novel objects in a novel spatial relation after habituation, only categorizers displayed asymmetric attention between the objects, attending to the dynamic object more than the static object. Gaze shifts and attention to the concave area of the container did not differ between categorizers and non-categorizers.DiscussionThese findings suggest that infants’ focused attention to an object in motion may play a key role in young infants’ spatial category learning, and support the idea that attention to objects can assist with encoding of the spatial relational information."

Hence, this study explores the attitudes and pro-environmental behaviors of Peruvian and Chilean citizens regarding marine pollution, with an emphasis on plastic pollution. For this, forty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with Peruvian and Chilean citizens, of which, through thematic analysis, semantic patterns were identified. Results show that the participants’ representation of the sea is positive and related to the connection they report having with this environment. Additionally, it was found that the sea fulfills recreational and economic purposes, reflecting an anthropocentric perspective, since it is associated with leisure and resource extraction, respectively. Both purposes are related to the causes of plastic pollution, although with differentiated effects. Anthropocentrism is also reflected in the direction that environmental concern takes towards the impact of this type of pollution predominately on individuals and society. Regarding pro-environmental behaviors, most of the initiatives proposed by the participants in response to marine plastic pollution correspond to individual actions, which could be due to the fact that they perceive a low commitment level from authorities to address the problem. In particular, the Chilean participants attributed a greater role to their authorities in dealing with plastic pollution, which would indicate a more institutional perspective of the problem. Thus, it is proposed that to address marine plastic pollution it is necessary to articulate individual actions with public policies carried out by social stakeholders such as governments, companies and non-governmental organizations, in order to build a more efficient culture of marine protection."

Two endowment conditions were crossed with two sex conditions . Participants underwent an Ultimatum Game in which they were permitted to conceal part of the endowment from an unidentified partner. Finally, participants completed the SRLS.ResultsThe results indicated that more cash than points were concealed from the partner, and men concealed more of their endowment than women. We further defined fake fairness in sharing that combined hiding a more significant portion of the endowment from the partner while presenting fair sharing of the remaining award. We found more fake fairness when money was shared than when points were concealed. Fake fairness is more significant for men than for women. For money and points alike, concealment was predicted by the global score of the SRLS and its five subscales .DiscussionIt was suggested that a monetary endowment is more sensitive to lying than game points and involves more fake fairness. Nevertheless, the differences are quantitative, and the same response pattern exists in the two endowment conditions. Replacing money with points is a proper solution whenever a monetary endowment presents difficulties. It was further suggested that sex differences exist in lying using an asymmetric information UG, where proposers were permitted to mislead responders about their endowment.

In general, the modified online MORI-v technique consists of the following main elements: original material, that is, two versions of a short film which are identical except for certain critical details; for example, in one version, a thief puts on a red cap, but in the other version it is black; the collaborative recognition test, that is, a discussion about the original material which leads to mutual misinformation; and an individual recognition test that checks the effect of the discussion on the memory account of the original material.MethodsA total of participants aged – took part in the research. Participants were tested using the online MORI-v technique: They were familiarized with the original material on their computers at home, and then they talked about it via a video communication app and completed an individual recognition test on their computers.

Building on Job Demands-Resources theory, we propose that happiness well-being positively mediates the relationship between perceived High-Performance Work Systems and individual task performance, while health well-being negatively mediates this focal relationship. Thus, happiness well-being fits the “mutual gains” perspective.

While student engagement plays a substantial mediating role, our findings also recognize the persistent direct influence of teacher support on psychological wellbeing. These insights have implications for educators and policymakers aiming to enhance the wellbeing of university students by fostering positive academic self-concept and teacher support while recognizing the importance of student engagement."

One focus has been on disentangling the puzzle of language evolution. Traditionally, studies have predominantly focused on intentionally produced signals in communicative interactions. However, in collaborative and highly dynamic interactions such as play, underlying intentionality is difficult to assess and often interactions are negotiated via body movements rather than signals. This “lack” of signals has led to this dynamic context being widely ignored in comparative studies. The aim of this paper is threefold: First, we will show how comparative research into communication can benefit from taking the intentionality-agnostic standpoint used in conversation analysis. Second, we will introduce the concepts of ‘intercorporeality’ and ‘bodily affordance’, and show how they can be applied to the analysis of communicative interactions of nonhuman animals. Third, we will use these concepts to investigate how chimpanzees initiate, end, and maintain ‘contact social play’. Our results showed that bodily affordances are able to capture elements of interactions that more traditional approaches failed to describe. Participants made use of bodily affordances to achieve coordinated engagement in contact social play. Additionally, these interactions could display a sequential organization by which one ‘move’ by a chimpanzee was responded to with an aligning ‘move’, which allowed for the co-construction of the activity underway. Overall, the present approach innovates on three fronts: First, it allows for the analysis of interactions that are often ignored because they do not fulfil criteria of intentionality, and/or consist of purely body movements. Second, adopting concepts from research on human interaction enables a better comparison of communicative interactions in other animal species without a too narrow focus on intentional signaling only. Third, adopting a stance from interaction research that highlights how practical action can also be communicative, our results show that chimpanzees can communicate through their embodied actions as well as through signaling. With this first step, we hope to inspire new research into dynamic day-to-day interactions involving both “traditional” signals and embodied actions, which, in turn, can provide insights into evolutionary precursors of human language."

In this paper, we investigated the effect of color cues on user motor performance in a mirror-drawing task between Virtual Environment and Real World , with three different colors. We conducted a -day user study with twelve participants. The results showed that the participants made fewer errors in RW compared to VR, except for pre-training, which indicated that hardware and software limitations have detrimental effects on the motor learning of the participants across different realities. Furthermore, participants made fewer errors with the colors close to green, which is usually associated with serenity, contentment, and relaxation. According to our findings, VR headsets can be used to evaluate participants' eye-hand coordination in mirror drawing tasks to evaluate the motor-learning of participants. VE and RW training applications could benefit from our findings in order to enhance their effectiveness."

However, the field of intellectual property marketing has become confused and faces challenges such as loss of uniqueness and weak consumer connections. Existing research efforts have focused on marketing strategies for branded intellectual property, but have neglected the important perspective of consumer psychology and behaviour. In this study, we use the AISAS model to segment digital marketing and delve into consumer psychology and behavioural factors that influence intellectual property marketing . This exploration covers intellectual property content at the attention stage, intellectual property value at the interest stage, emotional trust at the search stage, mental consumption at the purchase stage and fan interaction at the sharing stage. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data using SPSS and AMOS, and integrated a consumer attitude questionnaire. The final findings confirm that intellectual property content, value, emotional trust, spiritual consumption and fan interaction all positively influence consumer psychology and behaviour. In addition, we make consumer-centric recommendations to extend the life cycle of intellectual property and promote sustainable brand development."

This study redresses this oversight by investigating the impact of non-core departments on firm performance. Utilizing a comprehensive -year dataset from Chinese A-listed firms and employing the endogenous growth model, we scrutinize the influence of non-core departments on enterprise productivity and organizational growth. Our findings underscore that non-core departments significantly enhance firm performance. Furthermore, we observe a negative coefficient of the interaction term, implying the presence of diminishing returns to scale when amalgamating department diversity with firm knowledge. This suggests that while both department diversity and firm knowledge independently contribute positively to firm performance, their conjoined effect does not necessarily induce a proportionally amplified impact. Moreover, we found that factors such as the company’s equity structure, market environment, and the age and education level of executives may moderate the impact of departmental diversity on firm performance. This study enriches the literature by spotlighting the potential of non-core departments in propelling firm success and underlines the imperative for strategies that cultivate interdepartmental collaboration. The implications of these findings propose that firms can leverage the potential of non-core departments for sustainable growth, offering a fresh perspective for future research in organizational development."

The present study considered Italian families with -year-old children born through assisted reproductive techniques, to explore parenting practices and children’s prosocial and externalizing behaviors.MethodWe ran a Multiple-group-by-couple Structural Equation Model in which we estimated the predictive role of parenting on children’s behaviors, controlling for age, gender, and family socioeconomic status using the Maximum Likelihood estimation.ResultsResults showed that both same- and different-gender parent families reported high levels of parental warmth and very low levels of hostility and rejection; regarding children’s behaviors, both same- and different-gender parent families reported high levels of prosociality and low levels of externalizing behaviors. In addition, same-gender parents reported significantly higher levels of children’s prosociality and parental warmth than different-gender parents. Regarding associations between parenting practices and behaviors, we found a positive association between positive parenting practices and increasing children’s prosocial behaviors and decreasing children’s externalizing behaviors, in both same- and different-gender families, controlling for family background characteristics.ConclusionThe present study encourages future research to investigate how specific parenting practices can influence behavioral adjustment in children, focusing on same-gender parent families."

We expand on this research and show that these cognitive effects are present among Swedish schoolteachers facing a scarcity of time and social resources at work. From an initial interview study we developed novel survey scales to measure teachers’ subjective assessments of available resources and the extent of their scarcity mindset. We then related resource scarcity of time and social resources to the scarcity mindset using structural equation modeling analysis in a survey study with a sample of Swedish schoolteachers. This research provides valuable insights for addressing resource constrained work environments in schools and contributes to the broader psychological research on cognitive effects resulting from resource scarcity.

While the number of studies investigating the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on ADHD symptoms continues to increase, transcranial alternating current stimulation is poorly examined. Previous studies reported impaired alpha brain oscillation that may be associated with increased attention deficits in ADHD. Our aim was to enhance alpha power in adult ADHD patients via tACS, using different methods to explore potential therapeutic effects.MethodsUndergoing a crossover design, adults with ADHD received active and sham stimulation on distinct days. Before and after each intervention, mean alpha power, attention performance, subjective symptom ratings, as well as head and gaze movement were examined.ResultsFrequency analyses revealed a significant power increase in the alpha band after both interventions. Despite a trend toward an interaction effect, this alpha power increase was, however, not significantly higher after active stimulation compared to sham stimulation. For the other measures, some additional pre-post effects were found, which were not intervention-related.ConclusionOur study cannot provide clear evidence for a tACS-induced increase in alpha power in adult ADHD patients, and thus no stimulation related improvement of attention parameters. We provide further recommendations for the future investigation of tACS as a potential ADHD treatment."

It is essential to understand why large number of students choose to pursue master’s degree. This study aims to empirically analyze the factors that influence the intent to pursue a master’s degree.MethodBased on the extended theory of planned behavior, this study conducts a questionnaire survey of university students in Shandong Province, which has had the highest number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination in China for several years. A total of questionnaires were finally collected, including valid questionnaires. And then ordinary least squares regression was used to analyze the factors that influence the intent to pursue a master’s degree.ResultsIn general, the intent to pursue a master’s degree is positively influenced by attitude and subjective norms , and negatively influenced by risk perception . Compared with male students, female students’ intent is more likely to be influenced by risk perception and social factors . The intent of upperclass students tends to be positively influenced by perceived behavioral control , whereas the negative impact of risk perception on the intent is significant for underclass students. The intent of students in rural areas are more sensitive to risk perception than those of students in cities. In private universities, social factors significantly affect the intent to pursue a master’s degree. In ordinary public universities, the intent of students is more likely to be influenced by risk perception .ConclusionThe study is helpful to strengthen the understanding of the influencing factors of the intent to pursue a master’s degree. In general, the intent to pursue a master’s degree is mainly influenced by attitude, subjective norms and risk perception. Moreover, the influencing factors vary among different groups . Furthermore, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, risk perception, and social factors have greater impacts on the intent of students from low-income households than those from high-income households. This study can provide policy implications for universities to take targeted educational measures to encourage students to make a choice that suits their own development after graduation."

For example, if a child has difficulties with verbal narration to picture sequences, it may be interpreted as specific to spoken language even though the child may have additional difficulties with comprehension of visual narratives in the form of picture sequences. The purpose of the present study was therefore to increase our understanding of semantic processing in the pictorial domain in relation to semantic processing in the verbal domain, focusing on – years-old children with typical language development. To this end, we measured electrical brain responses in children to pictures that were predicted versus unpredicted in sequences of panels that conveyed visual narratives and words that were predicted versus unpredicted in sentences that conveyed verbal narratives. Results demonstrated similarities as there were no significant difference in the magnitude of the N effect across domains. The only difference between domains was the predicted difference in distribution, that is, a more posterior N effect in the verbal domain than in the pictorial domain. The study contributes to an increased understanding of the complexity of processing of visual narratives and its shared features with processing of verbal narratives, which should be considered in pedagogical practices."

In this setting, these principles are instrumental in guiding both educators and students. The study employs the Culture-Value Structure model to dissect the intricate dynamics between Confucian Values, the Effort-Reward Imbalance , educators’ job satisfaction, and their inclination toward leaving the profession. Teachers in vocational education, who are often regarded as moral guides, play a pivotal role in the ethical and social upbringing of students. Adopting Confucian values not only promotes academic success but also nurtures all-round development, equipping students for conscientious societal roles. In the backdrop of Confucian influence, these educators face substantial stressors in the workplace due to varied demands. The ERI model, proposed by Siegrist, serves as a tool to comprehend the stress experienced when there is a disproportion between efforts and rewards. This study delves into how ERI correlates with job satisfaction among vocational education teachers, with a focus on the modifying effect of Confucian values. Additionally, it examines the potential role of job satisfaction in mediating the relationship between ERI and the tendency to consider leaving the job. The research illuminates the complex interrelation of cultural values, occupational stress, job contentment, and career decision-making in the context of vocational education in China.MethodologyThe research involved a group of Vocational education teachers from diverse Chinese institutions. Through thorough statistical analysis, the study validated the model’s effectiveness, notably indicating a substantial direct impact of ERI on the Intention to Quit.FindingsThe investigation pinpointed Factors I , II , and IV as key determinants of job satisfaction. Notably, an increase in job satisfaction was found to inversely relate to the likelihood of leaving the profession, implying it could lessen the propensity to resign. The research applied a Chain Mediation Model to elucidate the influence of ERI on the decision to quit, mediated by various factors. The findings highlight the complex interaction of elements influencing teachers’ decisions to leave, showcasing the utility of sophisticated statistical methodologies in decoding complex social dynamics."

Using a dataset for a representative sample of male entrepreneur and male VC dyads in the context of stage financing, this study finds that VCs of below-average attractiveness are more sensitive to the physical attractiveness of the entrepreneur when compared to VCs of average attractiveness. Also, the nature of this effect changes from the first to the second investment round for VCs of below-average attractiveness. Combined, these findings imply that VCs’ funding decisions may be subject to mechanisms that stem from their own physical attractiveness.

Some of the most socially relevant traits constitute the Dark Triad – narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism – associated with antisocial behaviour, disregard for moral norms, and a tendency to manipulation. Sufficient data point at the existence of Dark Triad ‘profiles’ distinguished by trait prominence. Currently, neuroimaging studies have mainly concentrated on the neuroanatomy of individual dark traits, while the Dark Triad profile structure has been mostly overlooked.MethodsWe performed a clustering analysis of the Dirty Dozen Dark Triad questionnaire scores of healthy subjects using the k-means method. The variance ratio criterion was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the current data. The two-sample t-test within the framework of voxel-based morphometry was performed to test the hypothesised differences in grey matter volume for the obtained groups.ResultsClustering analysis revealed groups of subjects, both with low-to-mid and mid-to-high levels of Dark Triad traits prominence.

In addition, we tested the conditional influence of the presumed motives of gift-givers from the perspective of gift recipients based on the postulates of Self-Determination Theory. First, participants were randomly to assigned to one of the following conditions: Consumption-of-experiential gift or consumption-of-material gift conditions. After, participants filled out a battery of questionnaires assessing autonomy support and gratitude. Results showed that the consumption of experiential gifts was construed as more autonomy supportive than the consumption of their material counterparts, which then had a positive relationship with gratitude. In experiment two, we tested the proposed mediator, autonomy support, by asking participants to either recall the consumption of the gift that was consistent with their true values or the consumption of an ordinary gift and completed a set of questions assessing autonomy support and gratitude. Results showed that recalling a gift consistent with consumers’ true values led to higher levels of autonomy support than recalling an ordinary gift, which was then positively correlated with gratitude. In the third experiment, we conducted a conceptual replication of experiment one and added the examination of the presumed motives of gift-givers as a potential moderator. Results replicated the significant mediation effect found in study and showed that the conditional indirect effect was stronger when gift recipients attributed integrated motives to the gift-givers.

Risk perception influences attitudes and actions individuals take to protect themselves from future threats. Risk perceptions might change among different stakeholder groups such as society and first responders. Identifying risk perceptions of stakeholders is essential to establish effective protective measures.MethodThis study investigated the commonalities and diversities in risk perception among first responders and the public, within and between seven European and beyond countries. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data from both first responders and civilians. They were asked to assess their risk perception level for five categories of risks .ResultsUsing Univariate Analysis of Variance showed disparity concerning both the levels of risk perception between the public and first responders, as well as their relative ranking. For example, concerning extreme weather-related and nature-related events, risk perception levels of the first responders is higher than that of the population in six out of the seven studied countries. In contrast, the population’s risk perception is higher compared to the first responders in six out of the seven countries, concerning critical infrastructure dependencies and pandemics.DiscussionThe relative gaps between the first responders versus the population, within each country, vary considerably. Norway for example presents significant differences between the two internal populations concerning all risks , while in Sweden, no significant gaps were identified, concerning all five risks."

To determine clinically meaningful changes in QoL, we identified minimal clinically important difference . Linear regressions and Linear Mixed Models were conducted to determine factors associated with changes in QoL.ResultsOn average, QoL remained stable across three waves in PwDM, with a marginal difference only present between the first and last wave. However, when looking at individual trajectories, different longitudinal patterns of QoL were identified across the three time-points, with .% of participants showing stable QoL. Linear regression linked lower QoL to female gender, less education, loneliness, reduced memory function, physical inactivity, reduced health, depression, and mobility limitations. LMM showed that the random effect of ID had the strongest impact on QoL across the three waves, suggesting highly individual QoL patterns.ConclusionThis study enhances the understanding of the stability of QoL measures, which are often used as primary endpoints in clinical research. We demonstrated that using traditional averaging methods, QoL appears stable on group level. However, our analysis indicated that QoL should be measured on an individual level."

When navigating, people are overwhelmed with an enormous amount of information. However, some information might be more relevant than others. Despite the mounting knowledge about the mechanisms underlying orientational skills, and the notable effects of facial emotions on human behavior, little is known about emotions’ effects on spatial navigation. Hereby, this study aimed to explore how exposure to others’ negative emotional facial expressions affects wayfinding performances. Moreover, gender differences that characterize both processes were considered. Fifty-five participants entered twice in three realistic virtual reality environments: the first time, to encode a route to find an object and then to recall the learned path to reach the same object again. In between the two explorations of the virtual environment, participants were asked to undergo a gender categorization task during which they were exposed to sixty faces showing either neutral, fearful, or angry expressions. Results showed a significant interaction between emotions, time, and gender. In particular, the exposition to fearful faces, but not angry and neutral ones, decreased males’ wayfinding performances , while females’ performances were unaffected.

Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether deficits in basic numerical skills in children with DD are more indicative of a developmental delay or a dyscalculia-specific qualitative deviation and whether these deficits result from impairment of core cognitive systems involved in numerical processing. To address this, we tested children in the nd, rd, and th grades with different paradigms for basic numerical skills . The results revealed that DD children’s impairments did not indicate qualitatively different basic numerical skills but instead pointed to a specific developmental delay, with the exception of dot enumeration. This result was corroborated when comparing mathematical profiles of DD children in th grade and TD children in nd grade, suggesting that DD children were developmentally delayed and not qualitatively different.

These neurons have recently been considered to mediate an ocular dominance shift to the eye that has viewed a backward movie for long during which time the other eye is presented with a regular movie. Unlike typical short-term monocular deprivation, the visual inputs are comparable across eyes in that “dichoptic-backward-movie” paradigm. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the ocular opponency neurons are also responsible for the short-term monocular deprivation effect which is prevalently explained by the homeostatic compensation theory. We designed two experiments from distinct perspectives to investigate this question.MethodsIn Experiment , we mitigated the imbalance in the activity of opponency neurons between the two eyes during monocular deprivation by presenting video stimuli alternately.

The present paper explored the relationship between critical life events and psycho-emotional health among youths and the manner in which this relationship is mediated by the level of life satisfaction.MethodsThe data was extracted using a sample of participants from several cities in Romania, who experienced one or more critical life events during the last year. Data organization and hypothesis testing were performed using IBM SPSS and jamovi programs. For this purpose we used the simple regression analysis, Pearson correlation and mediation analysis. The scales used to conduct the research were: RS-, SRRS, ERQ, CERQ, DASS- and SWLS.ResultsThe final sample of the study totaled female and male Romanian participants aged between and who had experienced critical events during the last year, leading to psycho-emotional destabilization and a significantly lower level of life satisfaction. The prevalence of critical life events among these participants varied from one to five events and up to more than critical events in the past year . The presence of these events led to increased levels of stress, anxiety, or depression among participants. Furthermore, it appears that the presence of a high number of critical life events led to a decreased life satisfaction among participants, along with a greater tendency toward catastrophizing.ConclusionCritical life events are increasingly frequent events in everyday life, and youth seems to be the period with the most changes. The research findings add to current findings about the practical implications that critical life events have on psycho-emotional health among youths. Therefore it appears to be a close relationship between critical life events, psycho-emotional health, and emotional regulation. At the same time, it seems that coping mechanisms have a central role in the level of life satisfaction among youths."

Based on a larger ethnography conducted in Sydney from to , this study investigates the language ideologies of Chinese immigrant parents from the People’s Republic of China in the recent decades, regarding the maintenance of their children’s Chinese heritage language. Drawing on the concept of language as pride and profit shifting between communities across time and space, this study reveals that Chinese parents primarily emphasize the economic benefits associated with Chinese languages when it comes to preserving their heritage language. While the significance of cultural pride and identity remains evident, there is a notable shift where the concept of pride is merging with that of profit concerning the importance of Chinese heritage language. However, the commodification of Chinese and identity, privileging “national” mandarin while marginalizing “regional” others, impedes the transmission of diverse Chinese heritage languages other than Mandarin. Simultaneously, the value-laden calculation of language prioritizes the “most” prestigious English, often at the expense of “heritage” Mandarin, regardless of its acknowledged economic potential. The findings illustrate how language ideologies and practices within the Chinese diaspora are shaped by power conflicts between English and Mandarin Chinese, hierarchical distinctions between Mandarin and non-Mandarin Chinese, and subtle stratification within regional Chinese languages. The research underscores the challenges faced by minority communities in preserving their heritage languages, particularly those with limited economic capital or political influence."

Additionally, six categories of outdoor activities were identified in the qualitative analyses – leisure activities, relaxation, physical activities, social interactions, tasks and errands, and travel.DiscussionThe findings from this study provide evidence that the natural environment, particularly at home, can benefit work-related outcomes via greater time and enjoyment of time outside. This study has implications for employee time use and organizational effectiveness."

Childhood LOC-eating is a risk factor for the development of binge-eating disorder , but its neurobiological basis is poorly understood. Studies in children with BED have shown both increased gray matter volume in regions related to top-down cognitive control and reward-related decision making relative to healthy controls. However, no studies have examined brain structure in children with LOC-eating. To identify potential neurobiological precursors of BED, we conducted secondary analysis of five studies that conducted T MPRAGE scans.MethodsA total of , –-year-old children were included in the study, % of which reported LOC-eating . Age, sex, and obesity status did not differ by LOC-eating. Differences between children with and without LOC were examined for gray matter volume, cortical thickness, gyrification, sulci depth, and cortical complexity after adjusting for age, sex, total intercranial volume, weight status, and study.ResultsChildren with LOC, relative to those without, had greater gray matter volume in right orbital frontal cortex but lower gray matter volume in right parahippocampal gyrus, left CA/dentate gyrus, and left cerebellar lobule VI. While there were no differences in cortical thickness or gyrification, children with LOC-eating had great sulci depth in left anterior cingulate cortex and cuneus and greater cortical complexity in right insular cortex.DiscussionTogether, this indicates that children with LOC-eating have structural differences in regions related to cognitive control, reward-related decision-making, and regulation of eating behaviors."

This study examined children's scores on HTKS-Kids, a new, largely child-led version of the established individual research assessment of self-regulation, Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders-Revised task . For the HTKS-Kids tablet-based assessment, which was facilitated by children's preschool teachers, we examined preliminary reliability and validity; variation in scores predicted by child age and background characteristics; and indication that HTKS-Kids provides different information from teacher ratings of children.MethodParticipants included n = -year-old children from two urban areas in upstate New York, USA. Average parent education was . years, ranging –. A researcher administered the HTKS-R to individual children, and teachers were trained to use the HTKS-Kids tablet-based assessment and asked to play once with each study child. Teachers also rated each child on Child Behavior Rating Scale items about classroom self-regulation.ResultsWe found evidence that the HTKS-Kids captures variation in children's self-regulation and correlates positively with established measures, parent education was the best predictor of HTKS-Kids scores, and teachers rated Black children significantly worse and white children better on the CBRS, with the magnitude of group differences similar to the contribution of parent education. In contrast, Black and white children showed no score differences on HTKS-Kids.ImplicationsThe HTKS-Kids is a promising new tablet-based assessment of self-regulation that could replace or supplement traditional teacher ratings, which are often subject to implicit bias."

We included randomized controlled trials with learning performance as outcome. The random effects model was used in the meta-analysis. The main effect tests and the heterogeneity tests were used to evaluate the effect of human-machine feedback mechanism on learning performance, and the boundary conditions of the effect were tested by moderating effects. Moreover, the validity of the meta-analysis was proved by publication bias test.ResultsOut of articles identified, , participants were included in this study. Human-machine interaction feedback had significant effects on learners’ learning process and learning outcomes . Also, the positive effects of human-machine interaction feedback were regulated by the direction of feedback, the form of feedback, and the type of feedback technique.ConclusionTo enhance learning performance through human-machine interactive feedback, we should focus on using two-way and multi-subject feedback.

However, teachers are confronted with the challenge of not only acquainting themselves with the associated technologies but also effectively integrating them into their teaching practices. This dual challenge exerts pressure on teachers to adopt live online teaching. This study aims to explore the factors and mechanisms influencing teachers’ attitudes and continuance intention toward live online teaching. It covers both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, as well as both enabling and inhibiting factors, thus providing valuable suggestions for encouraging teachers to engage in live online teaching actively.MethodThis study proposed a conceptual model based on the Technology Acceptance Model, Uses and Gratifications Theory, and Communication Privacy Management Theory. A simple random sampling method was employed to recruit participants from a university in eastern China. With college teachers participating in the study, various analyses, including descriptive analysis, regression analysis, and simple slope analysis, were conducted to explore the factors and mechanisms influencing college teachers’ adoption of live online teaching.ResultsThe study revealed the following key findings: perceived easy of use had a positive impact on perceived usefulness and user satisfaction; perceived usefulness had a positive effect on user satisfaction; both perceived usefulness and user satisfaction positively influenced teachers’ adoption of live online teaching; perceived easy of use did not directly affect teachers’ adoption of live online teaching; privacy concerns exhibited a moderated effect on the relationship between perceived easy of use and perceived usefulness, as well as the relationship between perceived easy of use and user satisfaction.ConclusionThe study reveals a conditional process model elucidating teachers’ adoption of live online learning. The model incorporates perceived ease of use as a predictor, perceived usefulness and user satisfaction as two mediators, and private concerns as a moderator. The findings suggest that stakeholders should collaborate closely to enhance the design and development of the live online teaching platforms. Additionally, efforts should be made to support and improve teachers’ information literacy, fostering their enthusiasm and facilitating their professional development in live online teaching practice."

The primary objective of this study is to examine the influences of researchers' personalities on their research performance within universities, as well as the mediating role of research engagement in this relationship. The study encompassed faculty members from a university and employed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, measurement, and structural equation modeling as the analytical procedures. The results obtained from structural equation modeling reveal significant effects of faculty members' personalities on their objective research performance rather than self-reported performance. Specifically, conscientiousness and openness to experience exhibit a positive correlation with research performance. On the contrary, the neuroticism and social attributes of personality exhibit a negative correlation with research performance. Furthermore, research engagement mediates the effects of openness to experience and neuroticism on research performance. This study carries significant implications for the training and recruitment selection of faculty members in universities and enhances our understanding of how different personalities lead to a variance in research engagement and performance."

The CAAC provides both the quantity of activity and quality of accomplishment scores, allowing an empirical test of possible polymathy among students, some of whom were gifted. Polymathy occurs when an individual performs creatively in more than one domain. This investigation’s two objectives were to replicate domain specificity studies with the newest version of the CAAC, which included new domains and quality and quantity scores, and to use it to test for polymathy among students. Previous work with adults suggested that polymaths are creative in multiple domains. They often invest in creative avocations that support their professional creativity. Some evidence of polymathy was uncovered; however, it was not common in this sample. Support for domain specificity was reasonably clear in the present results, yet it was not all-or-nothing but rather a matter of degree. Domains overlapped to varying amount. The amount of overlap varied with the level of talent and from domain to domain. The clearest support for polymathy came from regression analyses which revealed a significant relationship between the quantity of activity in some domains and the quality of creative accomplishment in others.

In this article, we report the use of the prominent reasoned action approach—in its original state and an extended model with moral norms—for exploring the critical socio-cognitive determinants of individuals’ litter prevention intentions in Ghana. By analyzing the valid answers of participants to a structured questionnaire on litter prevention, we found attitudes and moral norms as the most influencing determinants to individual intentions in the original and the extended models, respectively. The analysis suggests that individuals will stop littering their environments if environmentally friendly interventions are implemented to elicit self-responsibility and moral obligation. Campaigns that demonstrate the effects of littering on drain blockage, flooding, and disease outbreaks may improve individual litter prevention attitudes. Installing waste receptacles in public spaces and communicating persuasive messages may facilitate personal antilittering intentions. Apart from contributing to the implementation of a litter management strategy to reduce the flood risk and enhance the resilience of the Greater Accra region of Ghana, this research helps to close the literature gaps in litter prevention behavior in developing countries, as well as support the implementation of the sustainable development goals and the global plastic action partnership."

However, it stands to reason that indoor quality likewise has an impact on psychological well-being. Therefore, the present study addresses the question of whether the subjective evaluation of home environmental parameters are related to self-reported anxiety and whether they can additionally explain variance beyond the usual sociodemographic and general lifestyle variables.MethodsData from the Hamburg City Health Study was analyzed. A subsample of N = , with available GAD- anxiety data was selected, and hierarchical regression models were computed, with demographic data entered first, followed by variables concerning lifestyle/habits and finally variables of the subjective evaluation of home environment.ResultsUsing the integrated model, we were able to explain about % of the variance in self-reported anxiety scores. This included both the demographic, lifestyle, and subjective evaluation of home environment variables. Protection from disturbing night lights, a greater sense of security, less disturbing noises, brighter accommodations, and a satisfactory window view explained almost % of the variance and was significantly associated with lower anxiety scores.ConclusionThe home as a place of refuge plays an increasingly important role as home office hours rise. It is therefore crucial to identify domestic factors contributing to people's mental well-being. The subjective evaluation of one's home environment has proven influential over and above modifiable lifestyle variables."

This study is focused on the analysis of the effect of aesthetic sensitivity in relation to indicators of health-related quality of life , the personality traits openness to experience and agreeableness, and coping strategies in people with SPS. The adult participants completed the Spanish versions of the High Sensitivity Person Scale , Short Form Health Survey , NEO Five Factor Inventory and Coping Strategies Inventory . It was observed that people with high aesthetic sensitivity presented greater openness and agreeableness, tended to use adaptive coping strategies and showed a slightly poorer functioning in different areas of daily living. Moreover, health-related quality of life, mental health and adaptive coping strategies occupied central positions in the correlations between variables, with a positive impact between mental health and adaptive coping strategies with openness and agreeableness. Lastly, the level of aesthetic sensitivity did not play a moderator role, and it exerted no differential influence on its relationship with the analysed variables. Now, it has been found that people with high levels of aesthetic sensitivity cope more adequately, which would cushion the effect that high SPS can have on mental health, specifically on anxious and depressive symptoms. It is concluded that these findings are relevant and useful for future propositions of prevention and clinical intervention, as well as for counselling in the psychoeducational, labour and family scopes, amongst others."

Nevertheless, previous methods that required controlled situations and large numbers of participants failed to incorporate real-world personality modulation analysis. One cause of this research gap is the mixed effects of individual attributes and personality traits in gaze data. Previous studies may have used larger sample sizes to average out the possible concentration of specific individual attributes in some personality traits, and may have imposed control situations to prevent unexpected interactions between these possibly biased individual attributes and complex, realistic situations. Therefore, we generated and analyzed real-world gaze behavior where the effects of personality traits are separated out from individual attributes. In Experiment , we successfully provided a methodology for generating such sensor data on head and eye movements for a small sample of participants who performed realistic nonsocial and social work tasks . In Experiment , we evaluated the effectiveness of generated gaze behavior for real-world personality modulation analysis. We successfully showed how openness systematically modulates the autocorrelation coefficients of sensor data, reflecting the period of head and eye movements in data-entry and conversation tasks . We found different openness modulations in the autocorrelation coefficients from the generated sensor data of the two tasks. These modulations could not be detected using real sensor data because of the contamination of individual attributes.

In this paper, we report a case study of a workshop with students at an elite university that drew on an intersectional approach to social identities , specifically, looking at gender and social class. We explore three key themes: the importance of group processes, the use of visual techniques, and the institutional tensions and the politicisation of social psychology research. Reflecting on this case study we argue that approaches to identity and inclusion in HE can benefit from intersectionality beyond the use of multi and overlapping identity and social group categories. We argue that research in this space is not neutral and needs to acknowledge researchers’ position about inclusion and diversity, perceptions of participants in research, and the motivation and aims of institutions where the research is conducted. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of integrating an intersectional approach within social identity research in HE when focusing on underrepresented groups."

To illustrate this, we employ topos analysis on plenary minutes of parliamentary debates regarding the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan, conducted by German Members of Parliament between and . We interpret their perception of Germany’s roles in light of key behavioral norms related to German security policy. The parliamentary discourse, shaped by topoi, sets the stage for decisions on German military operations abroad. The use of topoi is influenced by dominant thought patterns, particularly the perspective on Germany’s role in security policy held by the political elite. Political decisions, in turn, reflect behavioral preferences guided by these viewpoints. Our research reveals how changes in German security policy are mirrored in the discourse. This discourse is structured around five categories of topoi for legitimizing or delegitimizing military operations abroad: necessity, obligation, self-interest, capability and preparedness, and solution. An evaluation of the use of topoi through the lens of role theory indicates that perceptions of Germany’s role have evolved over time, encompassing roles such as a “civilian power,” a “normal state,” and an “agenda-setting role” in sync with its foreign military engagements."

The purpose of this paper was to determine whether disturbances in PD patients’ visual processing manifest through atypical performance on visual illusion tasks. This insight will advance understanding of high-level perception in PD, as well as indicate the role of dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia pathophysiology in VIs susceptibility. Groups of PD patients and neurotypical controls matched on age, general cognitive abilities , and mood responded to Ebbinghaus, Ponzo, and Müller-Lyer illusions in a computer-based task. Our results revealed no reliable differences in VI susceptibility between PD and neurotypical groups. In the early- to mid-stage of PD, abnormalities of the basal ganglia and dopamine deficiency are unlikely to be involved in top-down processing or depth perception, which are both thought to be related to VI susceptibility. Furthermore, depth-related issues experienced by PD patients may not be subserved by the same cognitive mechanisms as VIs. Further research is needed to investigate if more explicit presentations of illusory depth are affected in PD, which might help to understand the depth processing deficits in PD."

Despite the prevalent challenges such as material hardships, child care disruptions, and social isolation, some families evinced remarkable resilience in the face of this potentially traumatic event. This study examined domains of changes perceived by parents of young children that were consistent with the post-traumatic growth model as factors that facilitate family resilience processes.MethodsThis study drew data from the RAPID project, a large ongoing national study that used frequent online surveys to examine the pandemic impact on U.S. households with young children. A subsample of families was leveraged for the current investigation, including .% Black, .% Latino, .% non-Latino White families, and .% households of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. In this subsample, .% were below % federal poverty level.ResultsApproximately half of the parents reported moderate-to-large degrees of changes during the pandemic, and the most prevalent domain of change was appreciation of life, followed by personal strengths, new possibilities, improved relationships, and spiritual growth. Black and Latino parents reported more changes in all five domains than White parents and more spiritual growth than parents of the other racial/ethnic groups. Moreover, parent-reported improved relationships were found to indirectly reduce young children’s overall fussiness/defiance and fear/anxiety symptoms through reducing parents’ emotional distress. Perceived changes in the new possibilities, personal strengths, and appreciation of life domains were found to serve as protective factors that buffered the indirect impacts of material hardship mean levels on child behavioral symptoms via mitigating parents’ emotional distress.DiscussionThese findings shed light on resilience processes of a family system in a large-scale, disruptive, and stressful socio-historical event such as the COVID- pandemic. The five PTG domains could inform therapeutic and intervention practices in the face of future similar events. Importantly, these findings and the evinced family resilience should not negate the urgent needs of policy and program efforts to address material hardships, financial instabilities, and race/ethnicity-based structural inequalities for families of young children."

Grounded in the principles of ecological civilization construction and green development, this study embarks on a comprehensive examination. Initially, it investigates the varying impacts of environmental management system certification on both traditional innovation performance and green innovation performance. Subsequently, it dissects the underlying mechanisms and moderating factors influencing the latter, including an exploration of intermediary effects. The empirical findings of this study are as follows: Environmental management system certification emerges as a catalyst for innovation performance, with the primary impact observed in the realm of green innovation performance. Social responsibility disclosure is identified as a mediating factor in the relationship between environmental management system certification and green innovation performance. Larger enterprises, those equipped with robust equity incentives, and those operating in less competitive markets are more prone to benefit from the impact of environmental management system certification on social responsibility disclosure. This, in turn, amplifies the promotion of green innovation performance. However, the moderating effect of property rights on the mediating path remains statistically insignificant. Environmental management system certification exerts a more pronounced influence on green innovation performance in regions characterized by lower economic development. Moreover, it particularly stimulates exploratory green innovation performance, surpassing its impact on exploitative green innovation performance."

Specifically, the study sought to explore how the two positive psychological qualities of mindfulness and peace of mind may serve as potential mediators in the association between pregnancy stress and mental health of the pregnant women.MethodsSeven hundreds and thirteen pregnant women seeking care at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University were included in this study. The participants completed a self-report demographic questionnaire, as well as several validated scales including the Pregnancy Pressure Scale , Mindful Attention Awareness Scale , Peace of Mind Scale , and Chinese Health Questionnaire . The Amos . system was utilized to construct structural equation models.ResultsA total of participants had an average age of . ± . years and an average gestational age of . ± . weeks. Out of the pregnant women, experienced moderate or higher levels of pregnancy stress , while exhibited mental distress . Pregnancy stress exhibited a positive association with mental distress, while displaying negative associations with mindfulness and peace of mind. Mindfulness and peace of mind were negatively associated with mental distress. By employing structural equation modeling, the analysis revealed that mindfulness and peace of mind acted as partial mediators in the relationship between pregnancy stress and mental health. Furthermore, the identified models exhibited bidirectional sequential mediating pathways, suggesting that the pathways of mindfulness ↔ peace of mind mitigated the harmful influence of pregnancy stress on the mental health of pregnant women.ConclusionThis study adds to the current body of knowledge by investigating the relationships among mindfulness, peace of mind, pregnancy stress, and mental health in pregnant women. From a positive psychology framework, it provides valuable understanding of the intricate dynamics between pregnancy stress and protective factors of mental health. Consequently, interventions aimed at bolstering positive psychological qualities in pregnant women should prioritize the cultivation of mindfulness to foster peace of mind, or alternatively, the cultivation of peace of mind to enhance mindfulness, ultimately leading to improved mental health outcomes."

This study aimed to examine psychological distress as a mediator of the relationship between workplace violence and turnover intention among clinical nurses, and to investigate whether caring for patients with COVID- moderates this relationship through the lens of the affective events theory. We conducted an online survey of Korean registered nurses who work in clinical settings between August and October using the convenience sampling method. Psychological distress was measured using the -item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and workplace violence using one dichotomous item adopted from the Workplace violence questionnaire. We measured turnover intention using the six-item Anticipated Turnover Scale. Caring for patients with COVID- was determined using one dichotomous item. The research hypotheses assume that the relationship between workplace violence and turnover intention could be mediated by psychological distress and moderated by caring for patients with COVID- among Korean nurses. We performed a moderated mediation analysis with workplace violence as the independent variable, turnover intention as the dependent variable, psychological distress as a potential mediator, and caring for patients with COVID- as a potential moderator. The analysis revealed that nurses’ psychological distress among nurses had a statistically significant mediating effect on the relationship between workplace violence and turnover intention.

The respective surveys assessed the motivation for participation in telemedical assessments and supposed influencing factors, and the use potential of digital assessment and therapy technologies in daily routine, with a spotlight on brain tumour patients and the future prospects of respective telemedical interventions. Respondents included high-grade glioma patients , propensity-score matched neurologically healthy controls who were instructed to imagine themselves with a severe disease, and speech and language therapists .Results and discussionThe vast majority of the interviewed high-grade glioma patients was open to digitisation, felt well-equipped and sufficiently skilled. The factorial analysis showed that digital offers would be of particular interest for patients in reduced general health condition and those who live far from specialised treatment services .

While extensive research has explored the various consequences of gender inequalities for women, this study delves into a less-explored dimension, investigating whether and how perceiving gender inequalities is associated with attitudes toward minorities. Drawing on relative deprivation theory and intra-minority solidarity research, we examined the relationship between women's perceptions of gender inequalities—spanning workplace inequality, domestic inequality, sexual harassment, and social expectations—and attitudes toward gays and lesbians, transgender women, and immigrants. We also explored whether indignation, arising from recognizing unjust circumstances, mediated these relationships, and the moderating role of perceived friends' support for gender equality. The results of the path analyses unveiled a nuanced relationship. While women who were more aware of gender inequalities exhibited more positive attitudes toward gays and lesbians and transgender women, no such relationship was observed regarding immigrants. Indignation and perceived friends' support for gender equality were key factors in fostering positive intergroup attitudes. Regarding their moderating role, perceived social norms only influenced the relationship between indignation and attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between gender inequalities and minority group attitudes. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of gender inequality and its emotional impact can catalyze promoting coalitional attitudes and collective action among disadvantaged groups. The study also underscores the potential of close groups' norms in promoting positive intergroup attitudes, warranting further exploration."

The psychosocial importance of continued driving ushers the need for valid measurements in fitness-to-drive assessments. A driving simulator test could prove useful in these assessments, having greater face validity than other off-road tests and being more cost-effective and safer than ordinary on-road testing. The aim of this study was to validate a driving simulator test for assessment of cognitive ability in fitness-to-drive assessments.MethodsThe study included healthy participants. Internal consistency of the simulator subtests was estimated. A correlation analysis between results on the simulator and the cognitive tests Trail Making Test A and B and the Useful field of View test and multiple regression analysis were conducted. Finally, a comparison of results between age groups and was done.ResultsResults showed good internal consistency. Significant and moderate correlations were found for all reaction time in the simulator’s subtests and UFOV , and all but two with TMT A. Lane positioning in the simulator showed significant and low to moderate correlations with UFOV in all subtests. Reaction time and Double reaction time on subtest were significantly correlated with UFOV and UFOV and TMT A, respectively. Test on Centerline in subtest as dependent variable was significantly correlated with UFOV . Significant means differences and large effect sizes between the age groups were found for all reaction time and lane positioning tests.ConclusionThe findings of concurrent validity, especially with TMT A and UFOV and its sensitivity for age-related differences, indicate potential for the simulator to be used as a complement in fitness-to-drive assessments. However, a clinical study is necessary to further examine its usefulness for patients with cognitive deficits."

The study draws upon social exchange theory to propose that employees’ experience of HPWS influences their innovative behavior directly and through sequential mediation of social capital development and knowledge-sharing behavior. Additionally, the study uses the Elaboration Likelihood Model to highlight that individuals’ need for cognition strengthens the relationship between employees’ knowledge-sharing and innovative behaviors. The study employed a time-lagged quantitative research design with survey data from job incumbents in professional service firms. The proposed model was tested using the PLS-SEM two-stage approach. The findings of the study confirm the proposed direct and indirect relationships. Moreover, the findings also confirm that the need for cognition strengthens the relationship between knowledge-sharing and individual innovation behaviors. The study posits that employees’ experience of HRM systems can influence their innovative behavior as a reciprocal exchange toward the employer. Moreover, this study presents a comprehensive model that highlights the interplay of social and cognitive factors that can influence the relationship between HPWS and employees’ innovation behavior.

In order to specifically apply mentalization-based interventions, a better understanding of the relationship between interventions and in-session mentalization is needed. The study aimed to explore the association between interventions and effective mentalizing.MethodFifteen therapy sessions of three therapies with male adolescents with conduct disorder were transcribed and rated with the Reflective Functioning Scale and a newly developed Mentalization-based Treatment intervention coding manual. The coded interventions were categorized into intervention levels according to the MBT manual. Fisher’s exact tests were performed to test differences in frequencies of interventions in high-RF sequences compared with remaining therapy sequences .ResultsSpecific MBT interventions such as demand questions, affectelaboration, empathic validation, change of subject, challenge, patienttherapist relation and mentalizing for the patient were related to effective mentalizing. Moreover, intervention levels such as supportive &amp; empathic, basic- mentalizing &amp; affect mode and relational mentalizing were positively associated with effective mentalizing.ConclusionMBT interventions seem to promote effective mentalizing at various intervention levels.

In this study we tested an alternative view, assuming that self-control also rests on the ability to anticipate emotions directed toward future consequences. Using a behavioral within-subject design including an emotion regulation task measuring the ability to voluntarily engage anticipated emotions towards an upcoming event and a self-control task in which subjects were confronted with a variety of everyday conflict situations, we examined the relationship between self-control and anticipated emotions. We found that those individuals who were better able to engage anticipated emotions to an upcoming event showed stronger levels of self-control in situations where it was necessary to resist short-term temptations or to endure short-term aversions to achieve long-term goals. This finding suggests that anticipated emotions may play a functional role in self-control-relevant deliberations with respect to possible future consequences and are not only inhibited top-down as implied by “dual system” views on self-control."

The current return-to-sport criteria emphasize physical measures; however, psychological measures may also be valuable to inform providers of an athlete’s readiness. One such measure is athletic identity defined as the degree to which an individual identifies with the athlete role. To better understand athletic identity in return-to-sport, this study aimed to identify relationships and trends between the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale , demographic variables, sport participation measures, and the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory- in youth athletes during rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction .MethodsA retrospective review was completed of patients who underwent ACLR at a sports medicine clinic between October and May . Patients responded to a series of patient reported outcomes regarding physical and psychological function at a pre-surgical baseline and after year of rehabilitation. Patients were then divided into groups of high/low AIMS and an increased/decreased AIMS between year and baseline for comparison. Independent samples t-tests and ANOVAs were performed as appropriate with a % confidence interval.ResultsIn the final sample, patients were included, with .% being females. Total AIMS scores decreased from . to . over rehabilitation . Furthermore, results indicated that nearly all AIMS scores decreased during rehabilitation, with none showing an increase; however, not all domains were significant. Conversely, all sport participation and coping ability PROs increased over time points except for ACSI-Confidence and Achievement Motivation. Generally, those in the groups with high AIMS and an increase in AIMS also had higher scores in physical function and coping ability PROs, with the groups separated by high/low AIMS exhibiting more frequent statistical significance.DiscussionGiven these results, it appears that athletes may lose identification with the athlete role after ACLR and struggle even year for rehabilitation, but those who recover athletic identity the best may also be those able to cope most effectively with the stressors induced by injury."

Several studies have shown strong associations between sound symbolic words, shapes , and materials. Here, we identified these material associations in Turkish sound symbolic words and then tested for their effect on softness perception. First, we used a rating task in a semantic differentiation method to extract the perceived softness dimensions from words and materials. We then tested whether Turkish onomatopoeic words can be used to manipulate the perceived softness of everyday materials such as honey, silk, or sand across different dimensions of softness. In the first preliminary study, we used material videos and adjectives in a rating task with a semantic differentiation method to extract the main softness dimensions. A principal component analysis revealed seven softness components, including Deformability, Viscosity, Surface Softness, and Granularity, in line with the literature. The second preliminary study used onomatopoeic words and adjectives in the same rating task. Again, the findings aligned with the literature, revealing dimensions such as Viscosity, Granularity, and Surface Softness. However, no factors related to Deformability were found due to the absence of sound symbolic words in this category. Next, we paired the onomatopoeic words and material videos based on their associations with each softness dimension. We conducted a new rating task, synchronously presenting material videos and spoken onomatopoeic words. We hypothesized that congruent word-video pairs would produce significantly higher ratings for dimension-related adjectives, while incongruent word-video pairs would decrease these ratings, and the ratings of unrelated adjectives would remain the same. Our results revealed that onomatopoeic words selectively alter the perceived material qualities, providing evidence and insight into the cross-modality of perceived softness."

In doing so, the study sought to delineate the role of self-efficacy as a key mediator in the intricate relationship between the resilience of cadets and their professional achievements. The main focus of this study was to clarify the causal and effect relationships between the psychology and behavior mechanisms of the cadets. This was achieved through rigorous scrutiny of the moderated mediating effect of vocational calling within the multifaceted relationship involving cadets’ resilience, self-efficacy, and professional achievement.MethodsThe study’s participant pool consisted of individuals, comprising cadets in their third and fourth years of study, all of whom aspired to attain the rank of officer within the Military Academy. To rigorously investigate the hypotheses presented, a series of causal relationships among the four core variables were evaluated using a robust regression analysis methodology. To facilitate this analysis, the PROCESS macro .v, a Hayes-developed tool, was effectively used.ResultsThe findings of this study revealed several critical insights. First, vocational calling emerged as a potent moderating factor in shaping the relationship between cadets’ resilience and self-efficacy. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that vocational calling exerted a conditional influence on the impact of cadets’ resilience on their professional achievement, with self-efficacy serving as a crucial mediating mechanism in this relationship. In particular, the study affirmed that self-efficacy functioned as a comprehensive mediator, elucidating the pathway through which the resilience of the cadets ultimately influenced their professional achievements.ConclusionThe results of this research contribute significantly to enhancing our understanding of the intricate connection between the resilience levels exhibited by cadets and their corresponding professional achievements. Furthermore, these findings have valuable implications for the ongoing refinement of military education and training programs. They offer insights that could inform the development of more effective testing and selection protocols for military personnel, ultimately benefiting the armed forces in their pursuit of excellence."

In the current study, we compared time perspective profiles for a clinical sample, with a depression diagnosis with that of a control group. Additionally, we considered a measure known as deviations from the balanced time perspective that capture deviations across time frames, not considered in previous studies. A second obejctive was to test a model involving DPTP as a mediator of the links between cognitive fusion and self-compassion with depressive symptoms.MethodIn total, individuals participated in the study, participants with a depression diagnosis and without a depression diagnoses. All participants filled in questions regarding background variables together with Polish adaptations of ZTPI, CFQ, SCS-S, and DASS- using a web-survey.ResultsThe results showed significantly higher scores on Past Negative and Present Fatalistic in the clinical sample. In line with the hypothesis the clinical group also displayed elevated DBTP scores , a difference that remained significant when current symptoms were adjusted for. The results of structural equation modeling moreover indicate a major role of cognitive fusion in predicting symptom burden, regardless of the clinical/non-clinical distinction, but. Still, DBTP accounted for significant variance in depressive symptoms. By contrast, the inclusion of cognitive fusion and DBTP eliminated the association of self-compassion and depressive symptoms.ConclusionTaken together, the results indicate that levels of DBTP/fusion for persons with depression diagnosis is present regardless of current symptom burden. Thus, DBTP could be regarded as a risk factor of developing depression. Prospective research designs are needed to further evaluate the associations of the main constructs in this study and the extent to which they are predictive of future diagnosis and changes in symptom level."

A growing base of scholarship examining the efficacy of this form of coaching has identified numerous benefits, primarily for employees receiving this form of coaching, and some limited attention has focused on benefits for managers who coach. However, an important topic related to managerial coaching that has gone under-explored is the beliefs that managers have about coaching. Since beliefs often guide behaviors, obtaining a more robust understanding of the beliefs that guide managers who serve as coaches is warranted and several scholars have called for more research on this aspect of managerial coaching. Therefore, the study reported here presents a subset of findings that relate to the coaching behaviors that managers enact along with a comprehensive understanding of their guiding beliefs.MethodsThese specific findings are drawn from a larger qualitative multi-case study employing an adaptation of the critical incident technique that was designed to examine the beliefs, behaviors, and learning and development outcomes for both managers who coach and their respective coachees.

The -item Maximization Scale assessed individuals’ maximizing tendency in terms of the maximization index and its three subdimensions . The use of four coping strategies during the COVID- pandemic was assessed. Hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being were measured. We developed a mediation model and examined both whether there was an indirect link between maximization and well-being through the coping strategies and whether there was a direct link between maximization and well-being.ResultsPath analysis revealed negative direct associations between maximization measures and well-being. In addition, significant indirect paths were found with varying directions depending on maximization dimensions and coping strategy types. There were positive indirect associations between the maximization index and well-being via preventive measures, between high standards and well-being through preventive measures and cognitive appraisal, and between alternative search and well-being through self-distraction and social connection. Negative indirect associations were found between decision difficulty and well-being through cognitive appraisal, self-distraction, and social connection.DiscussionThe current study confirmed the existence of inconsistent mediation effects between maximization and well-being via coping and highlighted coping efforts as one of the positive aspects of maximization.

,2024,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1321053/full,"IntroductionAnimal and human ancestors developed complex physiological and behavioral response systems to cope with two types of threats: immediate physical harm from predators or conspecifics, triggering fear, and the risk of infections from parasites and pathogens leading to the evolution of the behavioral immune system with disgust as the key emotion. Integration of the evolutionary concepts of the fear module and behavioral immune systems has been infrequent, despite the significant survival advantages of disgust in various contexts. Studies comparing attention to ancestral and modern threats accompanied by fear have yielded ambiguous results and what qualifies as salient modern disgusting stimuli remains unclear. We do not know whether disgust or the behavioral immune system, as inherent aspects of human psychology, have adapted to safeguard us from pandemic risks or poisoning by modern toxic substances.MethodsTo test these effects, we have developed a survey comprised of short vignettes describing threats evoking fear and disgust belonging to one of the three main categories of threats: ancestral , modern , and pandemics of airborne disease. Each vignette was evaluated on a -point Likert scale based on fear, disgust, and anger. In total, respondents completed the survey. The data were analysed using a factor analysis and general linear model with the respondent as a random factor.ResultsThe results show that the strongest fear is triggered by modern threats , while the highest disgust is evoked by ancient threats . Interestingly, disgust does not respond to modern threat stimuli such as toxic substances or radioactivity as these evoke mainly fear and anger. Finally, a distinct response pattern was found for pandemic threats, in which both fear and disgust are employed.DiscussionOur study offers valuable insights into the emotional responses to ancestral and modern threats and their adaptation to pandemic challenges. Ancestral threats are not always more powerful stimuli than adequate threats of the modern type, but they function specifically. Thus, snakes and heights as fear-inducing ancestral threats form separate factors in a multivariate analysis, whereas all ancestral disgust stimuli group together. The threat of a pandemic forms a specific category and people process it emotionally and cognitively. These insights contribute to our understanding of human psychology and behavior in an ever-changing world."

All participants were able to withstand the assessment and reported good acceptance.ResultsThe results revealed a significant performance disparity, with older adults displaying notably lower proficiency in the DIGI. The DIGI performance of older adults exhibited a correlation with their ability to employ a set of novel mechanical tools, but not with their ability to handle a set of familiar common tools. There was no such correlation for the younger group.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study introduces an innovative assessment tool aimed at evaluating common digital tool competencies. Our preliminary results demonstrate good acceptance and reveal expected group differences. For current cohorts of older adults, the results seem to indicate that the ability to use novel tools may aid digital tool use. In the next step, the psychometric properties of the DIGI assessment should be evaluated in larger and more diverse samples. The advancement of digital tool competency assessments and rehabilitation strategies is essential when we aim at facilitating societal inclusion and participation for individuals in affected populations."

Despite assuming each measure is a proxy for continued delinquent behavior leading to further legal contact, few have examined the association between youth delinquent behavior and self-reported and official records of legal contact. Furthermore, systemic bias against ethnoracial and gender minoritized youth often results in more harsh treatment by the legal system, which could influence recidivism measurement. Latent variable modeling of legal contact is understudied; thus, it is important to examine the feasibility of measuring this construct as a latent variable, including measurement invariance by gender.MethodsAmong youth ages – years at first ever court contact, we examined three metrics of legal contact over a -year follow-up period: youth-report of arrest, caregiver-report of their adolescent’s arrest, and official records of the number of new court charges. We examined between-group differences on each metric based on gender and ethnoracial identity. We then measured: the association between youths’ self-reported delinquency and each metric, gender-specific associations between self-reported delinquency and each metric, and gender-based measurement invariance for a latent recidivism variable using confirmatory factor analysis.ResultsYouth were consistent reporters of their own delinquent behavior and prospective legal contact measured by arrests. There were no between-group differences based on gender or ethnoracial identity for any legal contact measures. Delinquency and all legal contact variables were positively intercorrelated for the overall sample and the male subsample. For females, delinquency was not associated with caregiver-reported youth arrest or number of new charges. The latent legal contact variable had unique factor structures for male and female subsamples, suggesting no measurement invariance.DiscussionYouth-reported delinquency at first ever legal contact was most strongly associated with youth-reported arrest during a -year follow-up period, followed by caregiver-reported arrest, and the number of new charges. Unique latent variable factor structures for male and female subsamples suggests the inter-relation between legal contact variables is gender-specific. Stakeholders should consider prioritizing youth-reported delinquency since it is most strongly related to prospective youth-reported arrest."

Guanxi refers to complex system of social networks and influential relationships that facilitate business and other dealings. Ganqing, Renqing, and Xinren represents distinct but interconnected dimensions. Ganqing refers to the emotional bonding or personal affection that is developed within a Guanxi relationship. Renqing can be understood as the norm of reciprocity or the social obligation to respond to another’s needs and to maintain the balance of give and take in relationships. Finally, Xinren: This dimension represents trust and credibility in Guanxi relationships. Employing online data collection via the Qualtrics platform, the study investigates the impact of individual adaptability on work engagement, particularly examining the mediating roles of different Guanxi dimensions. Utilizing Hayes’ Process Model for mediation analysis, our findings demonstrate a statistically significant direct effect of individual adaptability on work engagement, thus supporting Hypothesis . The analysis reveals that this relationship is partially mediated by other variables within our model. Significantly, the study highlights the nuanced roles of the Guanxi dimensions of Ganqing, Renqing, and Xinren in this context. Both Ganqing and Renqing were found to amplify the effect of individual adaptability on work engagement, confirming Hypotheses a and b. However, while Xinren increased the effect size, it did not significantly mediate the relationship between individual adaptability and work engagement, leading to the rejection of Hypothesis c. Furthermore, our research provides new insights into the interplay between these Guanxi dimensions. Specifically, Ganqing and Renqing significantly influenced Xinren, which in turn impacted work engagement, thereby supporting Hypotheses a and b. This mediated chain model suggests a more complex interaction between these factors than previously understood. Our analysis also reveals the differential impacts of these Guanxi dimensions. Notably, Ganqing exhibited a greater influence on work engagement compared to Renqing and Xinren. This finding underscores the critical role of affective bonds in social ties and their importance in enhancing work engagement. These results, robust across statistical metrics including R, R-squared, MSE, F, and p-values, are detailed in our results section and illustrated in Figure . The study contributes to the understanding of how individual adaptability and various Guanxi dimensions interact to influence work engagement, offering valuable insights for both academic research and practical application in organizational settings. These findings are contextualized within Confucian values and the ongoing internationalization of education. The study thus advances the theoretical discourse while offering practical recommendations for educators and institutional policies. Limitations and future research directions are also elaborated."

The aim of the messenger-supported therapy format is to work through conflicts that have arisen with people via messenger services. This is achieved in different phases of conversation, such as describing the situation, analysing one's own behaviour and defining wishes, by collaboratively drafting a message to the person from the conflict.MethodsThe data basis is a corpus of video-recorded group psychotherapy sessions. Methodologically, the study is guided by interactional linguistics, a linguistic research field that focuses on interpersonal interaction.ResultsUsing a case study, I show how the interactants work through a conflict through positioning, constitute group identity and relationships, and thus also transform their stance concerning the issue. Moreover, positioning serves the collaborative formulation of a message and thus also the change of the relationship to the person from the messenger communication.DiscussionRelationship management in eSA group psychotherapy can be observed on different levels: among the interactants in the room, with the persons from the chat messages, and between the patient and the therapist."

Furthermore, there is concern that the pandemic may contribute to mental instability resulting from the significant life changes experienced by the trainees. This study examined the experience of material deprivation among Vietnamese intern trainees in Japan and explored the correlation between material deprivation and suicidal ideation.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted between September and October , involving Vietnamese technical intern trainees. Data from participants were analyzed. The questionnaire included gender, age, duration of residence in Japan, proficiency in the Japanese language, income changes due to the COVID- pandemic, material deprivation status, and suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was assessed using the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between material deprivation items and suicidal ideation.ResultsThe mean age of the respondents was . ± . years, with .% being male. Among the material deprivation items, .% reported food deprivation, .% reported cellphone bill deprivation, and .% reported medical expense deprivation. Suicidal ideation was reported by .% of the respondents. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was associated with age , deprivation of food expenses , and deprivation of cellphone usage .ConclusionVietnamese technical intern trainees in Japan faced various forms of material deprivation, which correlated with a high prevalence of significant psychological issues. Suicidal ideation was influenced by factors such as age, deprivation of food expenses, and inability to pay cellphone bills. The experience of material deprivation could have intensified the mental health challenges faced by Vietnamese trainees, particularly in the demanding circumstances of the COVID- pandemic."

These values may affect emotion processing : the recognition, interpretation, expression and response to bodily sensations, translated as emotions. These varying values may contribute to distinct emotional experiences, impacting physical and psychological symptoms in breast cancer survivors.MethodsThis cross-sectional study investigated how EP including acceptance, expression , and awareness, may mediate the relationship between conservation values and symptoms of pain, fatigue, and depression among Arab and Jewish women BC survivors in Israel. Conservation values include tradition, conformity, and security.ResultsDepression and fatigue were negatively correlated with acceptance of emotions, and positively correlated with avoidance and conservation levels. Emotion processing mediated the relationship between conservation and fatigue and depression. Arab women reported higher levels of various values, emotional acceptance, pain, fatigue, and depression symptoms compared to Jewish women. Conservation was higher in Arab women and correlated with both approach and avoidance coping which was not the case in Jewish women. Avoidance coping had a positive relationship with fatigue in the Jewish, but not the Arab women. Similarly, approach coping was negatively related to depression in Jewish, but not in Arab women.DiscussionCultural differences are important for understanding the experience of cancer in individuals from different cultures.

Exposure to newspaper and TV news exposure has been shown to increase actual knowledge and participation, while social media is associated with participation based on perceived knowledge, without changes in actual knowledge. In light of these findings, we conducted an online survey in Germany to investigate the relationships between news consumption, knowledge , and participation. The study revealed that exposure to quality newspaper and public service TV news was linked to both actual and perceived knowledge, thereby impacting participation. However, tabloid newspapers and news from private TV channels were not found to be related to participation. In the case of social media, we found a relationship with online participation on social media and offline participation, but this relationship was only mediated through an increase in perceived knowledge. In other words, our findings suggest that social media use creates an illusion of knowledge that is linked to higher levels of participation. These findings highlight the democratic importance of traditional media channels, particularly public service broadcasting media. They also demonstrate how social media can lead to a false feeling of knowing, which can hinder participation processes."

This paper aims: ) to identify the metaphorical manifestations and highlight the discursive construction of disease as associated with sports fanaticism in a corpus of Saudi newspapers articles; and ) to seek plausible explanations for the emergence and use of disease metaphors in newspapers articles addressing sports fanaticism. King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology Arabic Corpus served the data for the current study. The analytical procedures were informed by the discourse dynamics approach and metaphor-led discourse analysis. Findings show that sports fanaticism could be associated with the following systematic metaphors: ) disease, in general; ) disease causes; ) disease symptoms; ) disease evaluations; and ) disease needs for medical solutions, interventions, treatments, and/or prescriptions. The discussion evokes a number of aspects: sports fanaticism emerges as a key topic; disease metaphors seem to be shaped and developed by the societal context and the nature of newspapers texts and discourse; they are enriched and influenced by the discourse situation and the needs to jointly construct and communicate intense experiences through specific evaluations and referential functions, which have a powerful resonance for the Saudi national and social levels; the use of disease metaphorical frames can structure our understanding and can simplify the concept of fanaticism."

This cross-sectional study included pediatric patients with MD and matched-healthy controls. The Social Perception Domain of the NEPSY-II, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test–Child and Happé’s Strange Stories Test were administered. General intelligence and behavioral and emotional symptoms were controlled for to eliminate covariables’ possible influence. The assessments were performed remotely.ResultsChildren with MDs performed significantly worse on most of the social cognition tasks. The differences found between the groups could be explained by the level of general intelligence for some aspects more related to theory of mind , but not for emotion recognition. Furthermore, these differences were also independent of behavioral and emotional symptoms.DiscussionIn conclusion, social cognition is apparently impaired in pediatric patients with MD, both for emotion recognition and ToM. Screening assessment in social cognition should be considered to promote early interventions aimed at improving these patient’s quality of life."

,2024,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1278744/full,"A large portion of human knowledge comprises “abstract” concepts that lack readily perceivable properties . Since abstract concepts lack such properties, they have historically been treated as an undifferentiated category of knowledge in the psychology and neuropsychology literatures. More recently, the categorical structure of abstract concepts is often explored using paradigms that ask participants to make explicit judgments about a set of concepts along dimensions that are predetermined by the experimenter. Such methods require the experimenter to select dimensions that are relevant to the concepts and further that people make explicit judgments that accurately reflect their mental representations. We bypassed these requirements by collecting two large sets of non-verbal and implicit judgments about which dimensions are relevant to the similarity between pairs of abstract nouns to determine the representational space of the concepts. We then identified categories within the representational space using a clustering procedure that required categories to replicate across two independent data sets. In a separate experiment, we used automatic semantic priming to further validate the categories and to show that they are an improvement over categories that were defined within the same set of abstract concepts using explicit ratings along predetermined dimensions. These results demonstrate that abstract concepts can be characterized beyond their negative relation to concrete concepts and that categories of abstract concepts can be defined without using a priori dimensions for the concepts or explicit judgments from participants."
